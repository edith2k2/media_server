want him to join you!}You're not serious about him 
joining your crew, are you?

03:05.690 --> 03:08.600
{I still haven't decided yet. 
I just wanna see if he's a good guy...}I haven't decided yet, but if he's a good guy then–

03:08.600 --> 03:10.960
{He's been caught 
because he's a bad guy!}He was caught because he's <i>not</i> a good guy!

03:14.300 --> 03:15.770
Mm! Yum!

03:16.380 --> 03:19.170
{Do you know 
if Zoro's at the base?}Can you tell me if 
Zoro's at that base?

03:24.700 --> 03:27.390
{It would seem the name 
"Zoro" is taboo around here.}I think the name "Zoro"
 is taboo around here.

03:28.320 --> 03:29.890
{Well, let's check out the base anyway.}Let's see the base anyway.

03:29.890 --> 03:32.160
{You're gonna be a marine, right?}You wanna become a marine, right?{Just for you, Feeso.}

03:32.160 --> 03:34.900
Y-Yes... But I'm not really ready yet...

03:34.900 --> 03:36.510
Rumor has it...

03:36.510 --> 03:39.360
a guy named Captain Morgan 
is at this base, and...

03:46.000 --> 03:48.120
What a funny town!

03:48.120 --> 03:49.400
{It's strange...}No, it's weird.

03:49.400 --> 03:53.900
{I understand Zoro}Zoro's name I get, but why are they 
afraid of a Navy captain's name?

03:53.900 --> 03:56.800
{I suddenly feel uneasy about this...}I suddenly have a bad feeling about this...

03:56.800 --> 03:59.410
{You sure they didn't 
jump just for fun?}You sure they weren't 
just really excited?

03:59.410 --> 04:00.920
{Nobody would do that!}That clearly wasn't it!

04:02.800 --> 04:04.390
All right! We're here!

04:05.350 --> 04:07.670
I finally made it!

04:08.420 --> 04:10.840
I guess this is where 
we part ways, Luffy-<i>san</i>.

04:10.840 --> 04:13.270
{It was only 
for a short time, but–}We didn't know each other long, but–

04:13.270 --> 04:14.580
{Oopsie-daisy!}There we go!

04:14.580 --> 04:17.190
Luffy-<i>san </i>! 
What in the world are you doing?!

04:17.190 --> 04:19.360
Now, where's this demon?!

04:19.360 --> 04:21.950
{He wouldn't be out here.}He wouldn't be out in the open.

04:21.950 --> 04:23.900
I'm sure he's 
in a prison cell or something.

04:23.900 --> 04:24.910
{There he is!}Found him!

04:24.910 --> 04:26.200
{Alright!}Perfect!

04:29.050 --> 04:29.920
See! There he is!

04:29.920 --> 04:32.210
{Yeah, right}I'm telling you! 
He wouldn't be out–

04:38.010 --> 04:41.480
A b-black bandanna 
and a h-haramaki...

04:43.200 --> 04:46.340
That's R-Roronoa Zoro!

04:46.340 --> 04:49.110
{He can get away easy 
if we untie those ropes!}If we untie those ropes, 
he'll get away easily!

04:49.110 --> 04:51.310
D-Don't be stupid!

04:51.310 --> 04:53.600
{There's no telling what'll 
happen if we let him loose!}If he got loose, 
what do you think he'd do?!

04:53.600 --> 04:56.200
I bet he'd try {to}and 
kill you{ too}, Luffy-<i>san </i>!

04:56.200 --> 04:58.190
Don't worry! I'm {strong}tough!

04:58.190 --> 05:00.650
{I can't believe this guy!}Is this guy for real?!

05:01.260 --> 05:03.030
Hey, you {guys}two.

05:04.290 --> 05:05.740
You're an eyesore.

05:08.100 --> 05:09.160
{Get lost!}Beat it!

05:10.370 --> 05:14.920
Luffy-<i>san </i>! {There's no way you 
could survive with him on your crew!}You're a goner 
if he joins your crew!

05:24.470 --> 05:27.340
{Oh, no! Stop her, Luffy-san!}Oh, no! Luffy-<i>san</i>, you have to stop her!

05:27.340 --> 05:29.050
She'll be killed!

05:30.300 --> 05:31.450
What?

05:31.450 --> 05:35.190
You must be hungry! 
I made you some <i>onigiri</i>.

05:35.190 --> 05:37.810
{Do you wanna get killed, pipsqueak? Scram!}You got a death wish, runt? 
Go home!

05:37.810 --> 05:40.400
Mister, you haven't eaten anything 
this whole time.

05:40.900 --> 05:44.200
{Here! This is my first time,}Here! It's my 
first time making them,

05:44.200 --> 05:46.320
but I worked real{ly} hard{ to make them}!

05:48.000 --> 05:49.850
{I ain't hungry!}I'm not hungry!

05:49.850 --> 05:51.500
{You're an eyesore! 
Get the hell outta here!}Now, stop bugging me and leave!

05:51.500 --> 05:52.260
B-But...

05:52.260 --> 05:54.550
I don't want 'em! 
Don't make me kick you{r ass}!

05:55.210 --> 05:57.330
{It's not nice to be a bully!}Picking on little girls?!{Crucifying and chilling!}

05:58.880 --> 06:04.260
Helmeppo
Captain Morgan's Son

05:58.880 --> 06:04.260
Helmeppo
Captain Morgan's Son

06:00.600 --> 06:04.260
You seem surprisingly well, Roronoa Zoro.{Phos: The line touched the infobox so I used the q2 tag to make it a one liner. So during proofreading or tlqc, don't make the line too long as it will go over the screen.}

06:04.260 --> 06:06.750
{Now there's another weird guy!}What's with that 
weird guy down there?

06:06.750 --> 06:07.940
Thank goodness!

06:07.940 --> 06:11.100
He must be with the Navy! 
Now that girl will be safe!

06:11.790 --> 06:14.990
{Oh? Those are some tasty-looking rice balls.}Oh? Well aren't <i>those</i> some tasty-looking <i>onigiri </i>?

06:14.990 --> 06:16.300
{Stop!}Don't...!

06:18.580 --> 06:20.010
{Too damn sweet!}It's too sweet!

06:20.010 --> 06:21.610
{Those're full of sugar!}You made them all sugary!

06:21.610 --> 06:23.520
{You're supposed to use 
salt for rice balls!}<i>Onigiri</i> are best with salt! <i>Salt </i>!

06:23.520 --> 06:26.860
{But I thought they might 
taste better sweet...}But... I thought sweet
might taste better...

06:27.800 --> 06:30.880
– Take this! And this!
– Stop it! Stop it!

06:30.880 --> 06:32.570
{H-how horrible!}H-How can he be so cruel?

06:37.660 --> 06:42.290
I-I worked so hard 
to m-make those...

06:43.710 --> 06:46.700
{Did you not read this notice?}Didn't you get the memo?

06:46.700 --> 06:50.100
"Those caught aiding 
criminals will be executed!

06:50.100 --> 06:52.400
–Captain Morgan of the Navy"

06:54.470 --> 06:57.560
{Looks like even little brats 
know how scary my dad is!}So, even the brats here know how scary Daddy can be.

06:58.080 --> 06:59.210
{Dad}"Daddy"?

06:59.210 --> 07:01.850
Then that's Captain Morgan's son!

07:02.360 --> 07:05.110
{You. Throw this kid out.}You. Throw the kid over the wall.

07:04.300 --> 07:05.110
Sir?!

07:06.400 --> 07:09.090
I <i>said</i>, throw her over the wall!

07:09.090 --> 07:12.410
{Or can you not follow my orders?! 
Don't make me tell my dad!}This is a direct order!
Don't make me tell Daddy!

07:12.410 --> 07:13.910
Y-Yes, sir... Right away!

07:15.620 --> 07:17.790
No!

07:25.100 --> 07:26.500
T-Thanks...

07:26.500 --> 07:27.920
Are you okay, Luffy-<i>san </i>?!

07:28.790 --> 07:30.690
Are you all right?!

07:30.690 --> 07:33.100
{I can't believe how 
horrible that guy is!}What a horrible guy...

07:33.100 --> 07:34.850
{Do you hurt anywhere?}Does anything hurt?

07:34.850 --> 07:36.950
Damn you.

07:40.600 --> 07:44.100
You sure are stubborn 
about staying alive.

07:44.100 --> 07:47.490
{Yeah! I will live the full month!}Yeah! I'm gonna survive 
the whole month!

07:47.490 --> 07:49.820
Well, good luck with that.

07:52.550 --> 07:54.300
{Ten days left, you know!}Only ten more days!

07:54.300 --> 07:57.380
Assuming you {can }live that long!

07:58.990 --> 08:02.210
{How can he be so cruel}What drives someone 
to be so cruel, Luffy-<i>san </i>?!

08:03.090 --> 08:04.420
He's gone?!

08:06.670 --> 08:08.920
I hear you're a bad guy.

08:08.920 --> 08:10.600
Are you still here?

08:10.600 --> 08:13.100
{Being stuck out here 
for all to see...}Getting put out here 
for all to see...

08:13.100 --> 08:14.840
{Are you really strong at all?!}You're supposed to be strong, right?

08:14.840 --> 08:16.460
{Mind your own business!}What's it to you?!

08:19.300 --> 08:22.110
If it were me, I'd probably starve 
to death in three days!

08:22.110 --> 08:24.480
{I got more spirit than you.}Then you lack my spirit.

08:25.490 --> 08:28.570
I will live through this...

08:28.570 --> 08:30.400
I swear it!

08:31.540 --> 08:32.900
{What a strange person!}You're a pretty weird guy!

08:32.900 --> 08:33.900
Wait!

08:35.200 --> 08:37.200
{Could you pick that up for me?}Could you... get that for me?

08:38.450 --> 08:40.770
You're gonna eat this?

08:40.770 --> 08:42.540
{It's mostly a mud ball now.}It's more of a mud ball now.

08:42.540 --> 08:44.170
Just shut up and give it here!

08:50.820 --> 08:52.290
Told you so.

08:52.290 --> 08:53.800
It was good.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.260
Thanks for the food.

08:58.390 --> 09:00.430
Really?!

09:00.430 --> 09:04.240
Yeah! He ate every last bite!

09:04.240 --> 09:05.570
I'm so {happy}glad!

09:05.570 --> 09:09.070
{Is Zoro really as evil as 
the rumors say?}But then is Zoro really 
as bad as they say?

09:09.070 --> 09:11.080
{No!}He's not!

09:11.080 --> 09:15.610
{After all, he let himself 
get crucified in our place...}After all, he let himself 
get crucified in my place...

09:15.610 --> 09:18.120
Huh? What do you mean?

09:18.120 --> 09:20.700
It's all that Helmeppo's fault.

09:22.010 --> 09:24.420
He's Captain Morgan's son...

09:25.810 --> 09:27.620
<i>Outta the way!</i>

09:27.620 --> 09:31.570
<i>Make way for my adorable pet-sama!</i>

09:31.570 --> 09:34.630
<i>Get in the way, 
and you get executed!</i>

09:40.790 --> 09:42.350
<i>No! Stop that!</i>

09:42.350 --> 09:43.900
<i>Hey, you!</i>

09:43.900 --> 09:47.060
<i>{You gonna complain about 
what my pet-sama's doin'?!}You got some kinda problem with
what my pet-sama's doing?</i>

09:47.060 --> 09:48.630
<i>Rika! Stop that!</i>

09:48.630 --> 09:50.230
<i>{We'll get in trouble 
if we go against him!}We'll get in trouble!</i>

09:57.180 --> 10:00.400
<i>– Oh, crap!
– He's in trouble now!</i>

10:03.360 --> 10:07.670
Helmeppo punches and kicks 
him while he's tied up!

10:08.380 --> 10:10.890
I... I...

10:10.890 --> 10:13.170
{I see...}So that's what's happening.

10:15.860 --> 10:19.010
I'm hungry! 
{Let us all eat for free!}Let's get a free meal!

10:20.870 --> 10:22.840
Hey! Bring me a drink!

Oh, yes.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.100

10:26.100 --> 10:28.100
{so I've decided to execute Zoro tomorrow.}I'll have Zoro executed tomorrow.

{Look forward to it!}Save the date, everyone!

10:39.940 --> 10:41.650
W-What the hell're you doing?!

10:41.650 --> 10:43.690
Luffy-<i>san </i>! Please stop!

10:43.690 --> 10:45.120
This guy's scum!

10:45.120 --> 10:47.290
Y-You hit me!

10:47.290 --> 10:49.600
I'm Captain Morgan's son, you know!

10:49.600 --> 10:50.790
So what?!

10:51.220 --> 10:53.750
{I'm gonna tell my dad 
and he's gonna execute you!}When I tell Daddy, 
he'll execute you!

10:54.250 --> 10:55.910

Luffy-<i>san </i>! Calm down!

10:57.690 --> 10:59.700
{Are you trying to get 
on the Navy's bad side?!}Do you <i>want</i> the Navy 
as your enemy?!

10:59.700 --> 11:01.540
I've made up my mind, Koby!

11:02.800 --> 11:06.520
I'm... {going to have 
Zoro join my crew!}gonna get Zoro 
to join my crew!

11:11.020 --> 11:13.400
I am...

11:13.400 --> 11:14.230
great!

11:14.800 --> 11:17.800
Yes! You're exactly right, Captain Morgan, sir!

11:17.800 --> 11:21.700
{But hasn't tribute to me 
been a bit lacking lately?}Then why are the recent tributes 
to me a bit lacking?

11:21.700 --> 11:26.410
W-Well, the citizens' wallets 
do have their limits...

11:27.630 --> 11:31.100
{The issue is the level 
of respect for me.}It's a matter of respect.

11:31.100 --> 11:32.580
Wouldn't you agree?

11:34.700 --> 11:35.790
{Dad}Daddy!

11:36.600 --> 11:40.090
{There's someone I want 
you to slaughter!}I want you to kill 
someone for me!

have lots of free time.}You've got 
nothing but free time.

11:48.590 --> 11:51.210
{I'll untie you, so join my crew!}I'll untie you if you'll join my crew.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.360
Say what?!

11:52.360 --> 11:55.760
I'm looking for people 
to join my pirate crew.

11:55.760 --> 11:59.400
{Forget it! Me, stooping 
to a criminal's level?!}Forget it! I'm not desperate enough 
to become an outlaw!

11:59.400 --> 12:00.440
Screw that!

12:01.170 --> 12:02.990
What's wrong with being a pirate?!

12:02.990 --> 12:05.500
Pirates are despicable! 
Who'd wanna be one?!

12:05.500 --> 12:07.120
Oh, {come on}gimme a break!

12:07.120 --> 12:10.370
You're already known 
{as an evil bounty hunter!}as a demonic bounty hunter!

12:11.100 --> 12:13.700
People can say whatever they want,

12:13.700 --> 12:15.830

But I've decided you're gonna join my crew!

12:27.200 --> 12:28.800
{Quit deciding on your own!}Like it's up to you!

12:28.800 --> 12:30.220
{I hear you use swords.}So you're a swordsman?{DemonRin, we wanted to keep the plurality of Zoro's sword usage ambiguous for when his weapons are revealed.}

12:30.830 --> 12:34.900
Yeah. But that idiot 
son took my stuff...

12:34.900 --> 12:36.440
{I'll go get it back for you!}I'll get your treasure back!{The word "treasure" gets lost in our cut, but Luffy refers to the sword as "treasures" in the next episode anyway. This translation can be found in the VIZ manga. To set a precedence for Luffy and Zoro to use this term for his swords, we are going to shoehorn it into this line.}

12:36.440 --> 12:37.400
What?!

12:37.400 --> 12:40.300
{So if you want your sword, 
join my crew!}If you want your sword back, 
you'll have to join my crew!

12:40.300 --> 12:42.610

{Is he planning to bust 
into the base by himself?!}He's... going in all by himself?!

12:55.800 --> 12:58.610
All right! {Stop there!}Keep it steady!

12:58.610 --> 13:00.340
Stand it up in one shot!

13:01.400 --> 13:04.290
{Dad! Why aren't you 
going to get revenge?!}Daddy! Aren't you going 
to get my revenge?!

13:04.290 --> 13:06.150
{The}That guy <i>hit</i> me!

13:06.150 --> 13:09.940
{Not even you've ever 
hit me in the face!}Even <i>you've</i> never hit me in the face!

13:09.940 --> 13:15.640
{Do you know why

hit you before? Do you?

13:15.640 --> 13:18.270
{Eh? Because you think I'm-}S-Sure... Is it because I'm–

13:18.950 --> 13:22.530
Yes. Because you're...

13:28.410 --> 13:33.750
"Axe-Hand" Morgan
Navy Captain

13:28.410 --> 13:33.750
"Axe-Hand" Morgan
Navy Captain

13:29.610 --> 13:33.750
my hopeless son who isn't even worth hitting!

13:34.540 --> 13:36.620
{Don't get the wrong idea!}Let's get one thing straight!

13:39.750 --> 13:43.800
{Your dad is 
the one who's great! Me!}The only great one around here is <i>me </i>! <i>I'm</i> great!

13:47.090 --> 13:50.800
{Which reminds me, I hear a rat 
snuck into the crucifixion yard.}By the way, I learned a rat 
snuck onto the crucifixion grounds.

13:51.790 --> 13:55.400
{I-i-if you mean that pipsqueak, 
I made sure she was dealt with-}I-I-I mean, there was that one runt, but I saw to her punishme–

13:55.400 --> 13:57.540
You killed her, I hope?!

13:57.540 --> 14:00.230
N-No! I mean, 
she was just a little kid...

14:01.300 --> 14:03.000
You, there!

14:03.000 --> 14:04.360
{Go into town and exterminate her!}Go to town and execute her!

14:05.210 --> 14:08.000
{Y-you can't be serious! 
She's just a little girl!}Y-You can't mean that, sir!
She's just a little girl!

14:08.000 --> 14:10.010
I can't in good conscience...

14:10.010 --> 14:14.500
Anyone who disobeys my orders 
is a traitor, even little brats.

14:14.500 --> 14:17.040
B-But... I can't do it!

14:22.310 --> 14:23.600
Lieutenant!

14:23.600 --> 14:25.300
Y-You didn't have to go <i>that</i> far!

14:26.340 --> 14:31.030
{It was with my strength 
that I rose to my rank of captain!}I rose to the rank of captain with
nothing but my own strength.

14:31.030 --> 14:34.140
Listen! In this world, 
rank is everything!

14:35.210 --> 14:38.890
{That means that I, the captain and 
highest ranking officer at this base,}Captain is the top rank 
on this base,

14:38.890 --> 14:42.860
{am the most superior person here!}which makes me superior to everyone here!

14:43.850 --> 14:48.110
{So everything I do is right!}In other words, 
everything I do is right!

14:48.110 --> 14:49.700
{Isn't that right, you guys?!}Right, you maggots?!

14:50.290 --> 14:51.780
Yes, sir! You're {absolutely correct}absolutely right!{Zenef: I prefer the original line, but saying "Yes, sir! You're right!" matches up better as a response to "Right, you maggots?!"}

14:52.440 --> 14:54.700
{The kid's death can wait for now.}We can execute the brat later.

14:55.310 --> 14:58.620
{Observe! This is the symbol 
of my authority,}For now, observe! 
It took years of construction,

14:59.250 --> 15:01.700
{which took many years to finally complete!}but the symbol of my authority 
is finally complete!

15:01.700 --> 15:03.810
Now, stand it up!

15:04.900 --> 15:08.300
Display my greatness 
at the {top}apex of this base!

15:11.950 --> 15:14.560
That's weird. There's no one here...

15:14.560 --> 15:18.560
{I gotta find that stupid son 
and get Zoro's sword back.}If I find the idiot son, 
he'll lead me to Zoro's sword.

15:19.700 --> 15:21.520
Pull! Pull!

15:27.020 --> 15:28.780
You, there!

15:31.210 --> 15:32.450
You bumped it, didn't you?!

15:34.410 --> 15:36.530
I heard something up there...

15:37.830 --> 15:40.640
I-I'm sorry, sir! I was careless!

15:40.640 --> 15:44.640
{I told you to think of 
this statue as me!}I told you this statue embodies me!

15:44.640 --> 15:48.630
The slightest scratch or speck 
of dirt is treachery against me!

15:49.200 --> 15:50.470
I'll {just }check it out!

15:51.130 --> 15:53.470
Rubber Rubber...

15:53.470 --> 15:54.890
Rocket!

15:54.890 --> 15:56.850
Now you pay!

15:57.510 --> 15:59.770
I jumped too far!

15:59.770 --> 16:02.230
– What is that?!
– It flew up from below!

16:03.010 --> 16:05.020
{I stopped!}Got it!

16:16.210 --> 16:17.120
Sorry...

16:19.830 --> 16:22.790
Seize him! I'm going to kill him!

16:23.610 --> 16:24.700
{Yes, sir! Right away!}Right away, sir!

16:24.700 --> 16:26.880
{Dad! That's him! 
He's the guy who hit me!}Daddy! That's him! <i>He</i> punched me!

16:26.880 --> 16:27.790
Oh! It's you!

16:29.300 --> 16:30.890
I've been looking for you!

16:30.890 --> 16:33.180
{Come with me! There's something 
I want you to give back!}Come with me! 
I need you to return something!

16:34.190 --> 16:35.470
– Let me go! 
– Helmeppo-<i>sama </i>!

16:35.470 --> 16:37.800
After him! Don't let him escape!

16:37.800 --> 16:40.140
Captain! {There's someone in the crucifixion yard!}Someone's on the crucifixion grounds!

16:40.140 --> 16:41.650
What?!

16:46.390 --> 16:49.020
{It's one traitor after the other...}Is there no end to the treachery?!

16:49.020 --> 16:50.980
{Please escape, Zoro}You need to escape, Zoro-<i>san </i>!

16:50.980 --> 16:53.940
You'll be killed 
for doing that, you know!

16:53.940 --> 16:56.950
{I can't stand to watch 
the Navy like this anymore.}I can't stand by and 
watch marines act like this!

16:56.950 --> 17:00.410
I want to be an honorable marine!

17:00.820 --> 17:04.730
{Stop! I can't escape! 
I only got 10 days until-}Stop! I'm not running! In just 10 more days–

17:04.730 --> 17:06.830
{You're going to be executed tomorrow!}Your execution is tomorrow!

17:06.830 --> 17:07.710
What?!

17:08.200 --> 17:12.800
Helmeppo never intended 
to honor your agreement!

17:12.800 --> 17:17.400
So Luffy-<i>san</i> got angry and {punched}clocked him!

17:17.400 --> 17:18.470
He did?

17:18.470 --> 17:22.390
{The Navy is after Luffy-san now.}And now the Navy's 
after Luffy-<i>san</i>.

17:22.390 --> 17:25.690
I won't ask you to be a pirate,

17:25.690 --> 17:29.740
but please, help Luffy-<i>san </i>!

17:33.610 --> 17:37.300
He's the only 
one who can save you.

17:38.500 --> 17:44.910
And I think, right now, you're {also }the 
only one who can save him.

17:46.460 --> 17:47.860
End of the line!

17:51.420 --> 17:53.260
Where's Zoro's sword?!

17:53.260 --> 17:57.740
I-I'll tell you! I'll tell you! 
Just stop dragging me!

17:57.740 --> 17:58.880
All right! Tell me!

17:58.880 --> 18:02.160
In my room... We just passed it...

18:02.160 --> 18:05.480
What? Why didn't you say so?! 
Now we gotta go back.

18:05.480 --> 18:08.190
– {Freeze}Halt! 
– {Let Helmeppo-sama go!}Release Helmeppo-<i>sama </i>!

{Go ahead and shoot, if you dare!}Shoot if you want!

18:14.340 --> 18:15.530
No! Don't!

{I'll now execute you two 
where you stand!}I sentence the two of you to death!

18:26.540 --> 18:27.540
This the room?!

18:31.330 --> 18:32.500

18:33.610 --> 18:35.650
{But there are three here!}But there're three of 'em!

18:35.650 --> 18:37.470
Hey! Which sword is Zoro's?

18:38.200 --> 18:40.220
Oh, he passed out.

18:41.930 --> 18:43.220
Koby!

18:50.100 --> 18:54.110
{This is some interesting 
stuff you guys've pulled!}Your actions here have been
interesting to say the least.

18:54.110 --> 18:58.880
{Were you two and that straw hat 
kid plannin' a coup or something?!}You and the straw hat kid 
weren't plotting a coup were you?

18:59.730 --> 19:02.120

{Unlike arrogant bastards like 
you who use soldiers as cronies!}Unlike a certain bastard who 
hides behind his terrified cronies!

19:06.580 --> 19:08.840
Roronoa Zoro...

19:08.840 --> 19:11.040
Don't you dare underestimate me!

19:11.690 --> 19:13.110
You may be strong,

19:13.110 --> 19:16.510
{but before my authority, 
you're as good as scum!}but that's meaningless 
before my authority!

19:17.390 --> 19:18.510
Aim!

19:19.120 --> 19:20.970
I...

19:23.500 --> 19:26.460
can't afford to die here!

19:29.690 --> 19:32.100
<i>{Match over!}That's the match!</i>

19:32.750 --> 19:36.070
<i>The winner is Kuina, 
with 2,000 wins and 0 losses!</i>

19:36.070 --> 19:38.400

<i>{He's even beat grownups!}He can even beat grown-ups!</i>

19:51.540 --> 19:54.580
<i>But he's weaker than me.</i>

19:55.450 --> 19:59.420
<i>Even with two swords, 
a weakling's still a weakling.</i>

19:59.420 --> 20:03.390
<i>{You losers'd do good to stay quiet. 
Your howling makes you pitiful.}You whine like puppies. 
You losers should keep quiet.{Original Japanese manga\: You loser dogs should shut up.}</i>

<i>{No, no. I do no such thing.}No, no. Of course I'm not.</i>

20:29.660 --> 20:32.410
<i>{Zoro did indeed grow stronger,}Zoro has indeed improved,</i>

20:32.410 --> 20:36.080

<i>Zoro?</i>

20:37.410 --> 20:38.490
<i>Zoro?</i>

20:38.490 --> 20:40.040
<i>I'm gonna wash my face.</i>

20:47.450 --> 20:49.140
<i>Damn it!</i>

20:49.140 --> 20:52.900
<i>Why can't I beat Kuina?!

<i>Kuina...</i>

24:35.640 --> 24:38.030
<i>Kuina's dead...</i>

<i>Apparently, she slipped and 
fell down the storehouse steps.</i>
