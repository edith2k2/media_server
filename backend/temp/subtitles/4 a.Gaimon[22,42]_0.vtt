03:17.650 --> 03:21.210
All right! Behold my work of art!

03:21.270 --> 03:22.400
Tadah!

03:22.400 --> 03:25.200
Who told you to make the flag <i>yours?</i>

03:28.610 --> 03:30.240
I guess that's more like it.

03:30.240 --> 03:32.240
Wow, it's pretty good!

03:32.240 --> 03:35.080
Yeah! It's good! I like it!

03:35.080 --> 03:37.580
So this is our mark...

03:37.580 --> 03:41.000
All right! Usopp!
Draw one on the sail, too!

03:41.000 --> 03:41.900
Right!

03:44.430 --> 03:46.920
All right! It's finished!

03:47.630 --> 03:52.070
Now the pirate ship, the Going Merry, is complete!

03:54.490 --> 03:56.120
I'm pooped...

04:01.020 --> 04:04.690
Is this the right way?
It seems kinda dangerous...

04:04.690 --> 04:05.860
What?!

04:05.860 --> 04:07.160
Wait.

04:09.310 --> 04:13.080
That's it! That's the place!
There's no doubt about it!

04:13.080 --> 04:15.870
Do you see something neat?

04:16.530 --> 04:18.580
It's the legendary Treasure Island.

04:18.580 --> 04:21.920
The legendary Treasure Island?
I've heard of it before!

04:21.920 --> 04:25.040
Yeah! It's a famous
island among pirates!

04:25.040 --> 04:27.380
As are the weird stories about it...

04:27.380 --> 04:29.300
Weird stories?

04:29.300 --> 04:34.770
The ones where whoever gets near the island incurs the wrath of a god...

04:38.800 --> 04:42.770
W-were the rumors really true?!
Is this the wrath of a god?!

04:42.770 --> 04:44.980
That sounds kinda neat!

04:44.980 --> 04:46.650
Luffy! You're not thinking of-

04:46.650 --> 04:48.360
We sure are!

04:52.850 --> 04:55.870
Let's go! To Treasure Island!

05:38.560 --> 05:40.790
I'm hungry.

05:40.790 --> 05:42.850
I'm going to take a nap.

05:44.030 --> 05:47.060
How can he fall asleep in such a creepy place?

05:47.060 --> 05:49.800
Yeah. How brave <i>is</i> he?

06:01.280 --> 06:03.270
What are you doing?! Don't scare me like that!

06:03.270 --> 06:06.990
N-no, I just thought I'd dance a little to liven things up!

06:06.990 --> 06:10.460
See? See? See?

06:12.220 --> 06:14.570
Stop that, Luffy...

06:23.080 --> 06:25.100
W-what is this?!

06:28.550 --> 06:31.180
Leave...

06:31.180 --> 06:32.220
Who's there?!

06:32.220 --> 06:34.390
Leave!

06:34.390 --> 06:36.850
Where's that voice coming from?!

06:36.850 --> 06:39.560
I am this island's protective god!

06:39.560 --> 06:43.190
If you value your lives, leave this island right now!

06:43.190 --> 06:44.590
The protective god?

06:44.590 --> 06:46.900
You're pirates, right?

06:46.900 --> 06:47.900
That's right.

06:47.900 --> 06:49.900
So you're pirates, just as I thought.

06:49.900 --> 06:52.900
Why would a god need to ask us something like that?

06:52.900 --> 06:56.340
Listen! Just try taking another
step into the forest!

06:56.340 --> 06:59.630
The moment you do, do you think you'll receive my divine punishment...

06:59.630 --> 07:02.740
and meet your doom?!

07:02.990 --> 07:05.220
How should we know?
Why are you asking us?

07:05.220 --> 07:06.450
What's this guy's deal?

07:06.450 --> 07:07.720
This guy seems kinda weird.

07:07.720 --> 07:10.760
What did you say, straw hat boy?!

07:17.310 --> 07:19.160
W-what <i>are</i> these things?!

07:19.160 --> 07:25.110
Humans I completely transformed
when they came to look for treasure.

07:25.850 --> 07:29.110
Then you really are a god?!

07:29.110 --> 07:31.730
Look at all these weird things...

07:31.730 --> 07:33.450
Is this a lion?

07:33.450 --> 07:35.250
Are you sure it's not a pig?

07:36.760 --> 07:38.830
Oww! Oww! Oww!

07:38.830 --> 07:41.960
W-what exactly are you?!

07:41.960 --> 07:45.120
I'm a rubber person!
I ate a Devil Fruit!

07:45.120 --> 07:47.520
A Devil Fruit?! Don't be absurd!

07:47.520 --> 07:50.350
I heard many rumors about them when I used to be a pirate, but...

07:50.350 --> 07:52.220
When you used to be a pirate?

07:52.220 --> 07:55.700
N-no! I'm not reminiscing
about old times at all!

07:55.700 --> 07:58.110
No, I don't want to hear
about old times!

07:58.110 --> 08:00.610
What're you talking about?
You're the one who said it!

08:00.610 --> 08:03.310
Are you <i>really</i> a god?!

08:03.310 --> 08:07.020
Shut up! If you won't leave, then you shall receive my divine punishment!

08:15.880 --> 08:17.370
Now you've done it, God!

08:17.370 --> 08:19.580
H-how are you all right?!

08:19.580 --> 08:21.960
– There you are!
– Don't move!

08:21.960 --> 08:23.750
I told you not to move!

08:29.030 --> 08:30.210
That can't be!

08:30.300 --> 08:34.200
Hey, God or whoever!
Pistols don't work on this guy!

08:34.200 --> 08:36.170
But they surprise me,
so I don't like 'em!

08:36.270 --> 08:38.520
M-monster!

08:39.020 --> 08:40.650
O-over there!

08:40.650 --> 08:43.060
Here it is. His pistol.

08:51.550 --> 08:53.910
Where'd he go?

08:58.030 --> 08:59.250
What is <i>this</i>?

08:59.250 --> 09:01.820
Is this a god?

09:03.260 --> 09:04.330
It's moving!

09:14.360 --> 09:16.800
Hurry up and lift me up!
I said lift me up!

09:16.800 --> 09:18.100
He's a person!

09:18.100 --> 09:20.430
Cool! Is he a shrub?

09:20.430 --> 09:24.470
What kind of a god are <i>you</i>?!
You were trying to trick us!

09:24.470 --> 09:27.070
Shut up! Lift me up, I said!

09:27.070 --> 09:29.160
Don't act like a tough guy after falling over!

09:31.400 --> 09:33.500
There. You're all set.

09:33.670 --> 09:37.210
Gaimon
Keeper of the Island

09:37.730 --> 09:40.670
You're a pretty popular guy, God...

09:40.670 --> 09:46.010
So you used these guys to scare off
everyone who came to the island?

09:46.010 --> 09:49.600
But I've never seen a person stuffed
inside a treasure chest before!

09:49.600 --> 09:51.810
Are you a boxed and sheltered son?

09:51.810 --> 09:55.230
Yeah. I've been overlypampered
since I was just a little boy...

09:55.230 --> 09:56.980
Of course I'm not!

09:56.980 --> 09:59.690
I can't get out of this box!

09:59.690 --> 10:04.650
I've been alone on this island
and in this box for 20 years now!

10:04.650 --> 10:06.360
20 years?!

10:13.930 --> 10:17.300
You've been all alone on
this island for 20 years?

10:17.300 --> 10:18.930
My hair and mustache are
just as you can see.

10:18.930 --> 10:21.170
Even my eyebrows got connected...

10:21.170 --> 10:24.840
It's also been 20 years since
I've conversed with anyone like this.

10:24.840 --> 10:27.600
Can you understand how painful this is?

10:28.390 --> 10:31.560
– It seems ridiculous.
– What did you say?!

10:32.790 --> 10:35.200
Oh, I found you guys...

10:35.200 --> 10:39.780
You were asleep this whole time,
even after all that happened?!

10:48.240 --> 10:50.530
W-who's this guy?!

10:50.530 --> 10:51.980
You should've noticed sooner.

10:51.980 --> 10:54.240
He's a human stuffed in a treasure chest!

10:54.240 --> 10:56.500
Are you a boxed and sheltered son?!

10:56.500 --> 10:59.960
Yeah. I've been overlypampered
since I was just a little boy...

10:59.960 --> 11:01.330
Of course I'm not!

11:01.330 --> 11:03.350
Don't do the same stupid gag twice!

11:03.350 --> 11:05.560
Zoro! Gimme a hand!

11:05.560 --> 11:06.300
Ouch! Ouch!

11:06.300 --> 11:10.890
What are you doing?! Stop it!
You're pulling my head off!

11:10.890 --> 11:13.200
You're right! You <i>can't</i> get out!

11:13.200 --> 11:14.680
Don't be crazy!

11:14.770 --> 11:16.900
Because of my lack of
exercise over the years,

11:16.900 --> 11:20.150
this treasure chest is the same size as my body now!

11:20.150 --> 11:22.860
If you try to break it,
my body'll get destroyed, too!

11:22.860 --> 11:25.880
He's a strangely annoying guy.

11:25.880 --> 11:28.670
But who are you guys?

11:28.670 --> 11:33.180
You're <i>nothing</i> like any of
the other pirates who've come here.

11:33.180 --> 11:34.370
I'm Luffy!

11:34.370 --> 11:37.750
I'm gonna be the Pirate King,
and find the One Piece!

11:37.750 --> 11:39.230
The One Piece?!

11:39.230 --> 11:43.010
Don't tell me you're seriously
planning to enter the Grand Line?!

11:43.010 --> 11:44.800
We even have a chart of the Grand Line!

11:44.800 --> 11:49.740
Don't take it lightly! That place
is Hell, or a graveyard!

11:49.740 --> 11:54.640
I once saw pirates who'd managed
to escape from the Grand Line!

11:54.640 --> 11:58.530
They looked almost like people
who had died and lost their souls!

11:58.530 --> 12:00.530
Something incredibly
horrific must've happened,

12:00.530 --> 12:03.030
or they must've run into
monsters or something...

12:03.030 --> 12:06.820
Not a single one of them
even <i>tried</i> to speak.

12:06.910 --> 12:10.040
On top of that, rumors about the
One Piece spawn even more rumors,

12:10.040 --> 12:12.530
so there's no telling
what's true or not!

12:12.530 --> 12:15.750
Some 20 odd years since the start
of the Great Pirate Era,

12:15.750 --> 12:20.500
One Piece is already a dream
within a dream beyond a legend!

12:23.420 --> 12:25.670
So where is the Grand Line?

12:25.670 --> 12:28.430
Dunno. Don't <i>you</i> know,
old shrub guy?

12:28.430 --> 12:30.680
I can't read sea charts one bit.

12:30.680 --> 12:33.880
Oh. Then we're the same.

12:33.880 --> 12:36.690
That's not a pirate conversation!

12:36.690 --> 12:39.580
Anyways, even if we do
enter the Grand Line,

12:39.580 --> 12:43.520
earning as much money as we can,
then escaping, is the best idea.

12:43.520 --> 12:46.440
I'll find the One Piece!
I'm lucky!

12:46.440 --> 12:49.320
Where does all that confidence
of yours come from?

12:49.320 --> 12:52.280
I <i>will</i> get it! You'll see!

12:52.280 --> 12:54.300
Whatever you say...

12:55.760 --> 12:58.210
You're the same...

12:58.210 --> 13:02.080
You're just like me; you even
<i>look</i> like me, like we're twins!

13:02.080 --> 13:04.250
How in the world does
he look like you?!

13:04.250 --> 13:07.710
I understand! Achieving
your dreams someday!

13:07.710 --> 13:10.550
We used to think the same way!

13:10.550 --> 13:12.340
We?

13:12.340 --> 13:15.520
We were willing to put our lives
on the line to search for treasure!

13:15.520 --> 13:19.560
It was that zeal that
changed my entire life!

13:19.560 --> 13:21.000
W-wait. What do you mean?

13:21.000 --> 13:27.580
It was 20 years ago. My fellow
pirates and I landed on this island.

13:28.370 --> 13:32.870
To find the treasure that
was said to rest here.

13:35.490 --> 13:38.700
200 men have searched for a month now,

13:38.700 --> 13:39.910
but it's no use!

13:39.910 --> 13:43.500
All we've found on this island
is this one empty treasure chest!

13:43.500 --> 13:45.970
We're leaving, men!

13:48.620 --> 13:51.510
What're you doing, Gaimon?
We're going on ahead!

13:51.510 --> 13:52.940
Yeah.

13:52.460 --> 13:54.480
Gaimon
(20 Years Ago)

13:55.220 --> 13:58.350
Did anyone look up there?

13:58.350 --> 14:01.570
The captain stayed down
<i>here the whole month...</i>

14:04.280 --> 14:06.710
I'll check it out one last time!

14:12.470 --> 14:15.250
I couldn't believe my own eyes!

14:15.250 --> 14:18.420
I-I found it! It's up here!

14:18.420 --> 14:21.590
Hey! Guys!

14:30.430 --> 14:33.680
That's when I got stuck in the chest!

14:34.580 --> 14:38.390
When I came to, my crew was
already far out to sea.

14:39.310 --> 14:42.140
Crap!

14:42.140 --> 14:48.360
Wait a minute! Does that mean
that fortune is all mine?!

14:48.360 --> 14:50.370
I can't climb up like this!

14:50.370 --> 14:53.990
I can't get out! I can't get out!

14:55.430 --> 14:59.630
Hey! Come back!

14:59.630 --> 15:01.500
Even after all this time,

15:01.500 --> 15:06.580
the fortune I only saw for
an instant has never left my mind.

15:06.580 --> 15:10.250
Pirates have come to this island
in search of treasure countless times,

15:10.250 --> 15:13.350
but I used these guys
to scare them all away.

15:13.350 --> 15:18.680
That's how I've protected
the treasure for 20 years now!

15:19.310 --> 15:20.970
It's mine!

15:20.970 --> 15:24.190
Yeah! No question about it!
It's yours!

15:24.190 --> 15:29.400
All right, Gaimon-<i>san</i>!
We'll get the treasure for you!

15:30.020 --> 15:32.240
– R-really?!
– Yeah!

15:32.240 --> 15:33.410
Don't tell me you're gonna...

15:33.410 --> 15:36.530
Aren't you a thief who
only steals from pirates?

15:36.530 --> 15:38.320
How rude!

15:38.320 --> 15:40.870
Even I know what's
appropriate and what's not!

16:04.480 --> 16:06.110
Here?

16:06.110 --> 16:09.410
I haven't been here
for a while myself.

16:14.270 --> 16:18.490
The time has finally come!
Today is a great day!

16:18.490 --> 16:20.000
I'm counting on you, Straw Hat!

16:20.000 --> 16:20.540
All right!

16:20.540 --> 16:22.080
Rubber-Rubber...

16:25.750 --> 16:28.630
Rocket!

16:37.150 --> 16:39.610
W-well?! Is it there?!

16:44.550 --> 16:47.570
I found 'em! Six treasure chests!

16:47.570 --> 16:50.000
W-well done!

16:51.410 --> 16:55.380
I finally got it!
The treasure! The treasure!

16:55.380 --> 16:59.550
Toss my treasure down here!

16:59.550 --> 17:01.170
– Hurry! Hurry!
– No.

17:01.170 --> 17:03.160
What?!

17:03.160 --> 17:06.510
No! I don't wanna toss it down!

17:06.510 --> 17:09.790
What are you talking about?!
Quit joking around!

17:14.950 --> 17:17.100
Quit clowning around, you!

17:17.100 --> 17:18.410
It's all right.

17:19.080 --> 17:21.580
– It doesn't matter anymore.
– Of course it does!

17:21.580 --> 17:25.960
Yeah! You've guarded that treasure
for 20 years, Gaimon-<i>san</i>!

17:27.090 --> 17:28.920
Straw Hat. You're...

17:29.170 --> 17:31.880
a great guy!

17:32.550 --> 17:34.090
What do you mean?

17:34.760 --> 17:39.260
I had a slight inkling
that might be the case...

17:39.260 --> 17:42.480
I tried to avoid thinking
about it, but...

17:43.680 --> 17:46.650
They're empty, aren't they?

17:47.870 --> 17:50.850
Yeah. They're all empty.

17:50.850 --> 17:55.530
It happens all the time with treasures
that have treasure maps...

17:55.530 --> 17:58.660
You go to look, but someone's
already stolen it.

17:58.660 --> 18:02.750
That's how much of an ordeal
treasure-hunting is for pirates.

18:02.750 --> 18:07.380
You can wait all your life, or lose
your life, and never touch treasure...

18:07.380 --> 18:10.680
There are more pirates like
that than you can count!

18:12.200 --> 18:14.960
Don't be so upset, old guy!

18:14.960 --> 18:17.460
It's a good thing
we came after 20 years!

18:17.460 --> 18:20.640
30 years later and you
might've been dead!

18:21.640 --> 18:23.130
Straw Hat...

18:23.130 --> 18:25.140
– Luffy...
– He's...

18:25.140 --> 18:26.820
You've made this much
of a fool of yourself!

18:26.820 --> 18:32.240
All that's left now is the One Piece!
Come be a pirate again with us!

18:32.240 --> 18:36.860
You're... inviting <i>me</i>?!

18:36.860 --> 18:42.200
No one's even tried to talk to me
before when they saw me like this!

18:42.200 --> 18:45.540
How many years it's been
since I trusted someone!

18:52.130 --> 18:54.510
Thank you...

19:05.050 --> 19:08.650
You're really gonna stay
on this island, old guy?

19:08.650 --> 19:09.780
Yeah, Straw Hat.

19:09.780 --> 19:13.940
Even if there is no treasure, there's
something else I want to protect.

19:13.940 --> 19:17.030
– Eh?
– Something else you want to protect?

19:18.070 --> 19:22.070
I've shared hard times and happy
times with these guys for 20 years.

19:22.070 --> 19:24.650
I can't leave them now.

19:31.720 --> 19:36.720
Now that I know there's no treasure,
I somehow finally feel free.

19:36.720 --> 19:39.990
I think I can really live
a life I want now.

19:39.990 --> 19:43.390
Plus, I've actually grown
a bit fond of being in this box!

19:43.390 --> 19:46.800
Oh! That's too bad, then!
You're a neat old guy, too!

19:46.800 --> 19:49.300
So the weird creatures
are your true friends...

19:49.300 --> 19:52.150
He's the weirdest creature
of them all, though!

19:52.150 --> 19:53.780
Say what?!

20:02.650 --> 20:06.120
See ya! Take care!

20:06.120 --> 20:08.630
Bye!

20:10.630 --> 20:12.540
Straw Hat...

20:12.540 --> 20:16.170
Strive for your dream, for me.

20:16.170 --> 20:19.180
You, if anyone, will surely get

20:19.180 --> 20:22.680
the legendary treasure,
the One Piece!

20:23.630 --> 20:29.940
And then... buy the world!
