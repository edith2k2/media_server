03:34.910 --> 03:36.790
{This is our first prey in a while.}Been awhile since our last prey.

03:36.790 --> 03:38.090
That's right!

03:38.090 --> 03:40.930
All right! {Start pounding the ship!}Give that ship a poundin'!

04:05.930 --> 04:11.990
Men! Show 'em the terror of 
the lady pirate, Iron Mace Alvida!

04:21.610 --> 04:23.890
Koby! What're you doin'?!

04:23.890 --> 04:26.200
I-I'm not good 
at this sort of thing.

04:26.200 --> 04:30.120
{Hmm?! Are you tryin' 
to give me backtalk?!}Wha–?! Ya givin' me lip, boy?!

04:31.290 --> 04:34.800
{P-Please, anything but the club!}P-Please! Not the mace!

04:34.800 --> 04:37.500
Then get yer ass in gear!

04:58.110 --> 05:03.490
We won't take yer lives, 
but we <i>will</i> take {all yer valuables}all yer goods!

05:03.490 --> 05:08.320
{Anyone who tries to fight back 
winds up at the bottom of the ocean!}Try to fight back and you'll 
end up at the bottom of the ocean!

05:08.790 --> 05:11.000
Hello.

05:12.700 --> 05:15.650
{There's no one in here, right?}No one's in here, right?

05:16.560 --> 05:18.280
Thank goodness.

05:20.810 --> 05:23.840
{That's a rather large barrel...}What a big barrel...

05:30.500 --> 05:31.850
Hey, {coward}wimp!

05:31.850 --> 05:34.720
{So yer hidin' out again
in a place like this?!}So yer hidin' out again, huh?!

05:34.720 --> 05:39.900
N-No! I thought I should just roll 
this {big }barrel of alcohol over...

05:39.900 --> 05:42.000
We'll lighten it for ya!

05:42.000 --> 05:43.470
I was just gettin' thirsty too!

05:43.470 --> 05:46.820
You can't! Alvida-<i>sama</i> will 
kill us if she finds out!

05:46.820 --> 05:49.500
Then {you just need 
to }you just gotta keep
 yer mouth shut!

05:49.500 --> 05:51.330
Right, Koby?

05:52.160 --> 05:54.910
Y-Yes! Absolutely!

05:54.910 --> 05:56.100
Thing's {pretty }heavy!

05:56.100 --> 05:57.790
Can't wait!

05:57.790 --> 06:01.250
Hold yer horses! 
I'll bust it right open!

06:18.840 --> 06:25.150
{I slept great!}What a great nap!

06:29.700 --> 06:30.900
Huh?

06:34.200 --> 06:35.450
Who're you guys?

06:35.450 --> 06:37.400
{No, who}Who the hell are <i>you </i>?!

06:37.400 --> 06:39.550
{That guy's gonna catch cold 
if he sleeps there, y'know.}That guy'll catch a cold 
napping there.

06:39.550 --> 06:41.170
{You did that!}It's your fault!

06:42.590 --> 06:47.670
{Are you toyin' with us even when 
you know we're pirates?!}Bastard! Don't you know it's a 
bad idea to piss off pirates?!

06:47.670 --> 06:49.900
Man, I'm hungry! You got any food?

06:49.900 --> 06:51.640
Listen when yer bein' talked to!

06:52.120 --> 06:54.950
You damn {kid}brat!

06:56.390 --> 06:57.770
Die!

07:14.190 --> 07:16.200
What's the big idea?

07:16.200 --> 07:18.400
W-Who are you?!

07:18.400 --> 07:19.160
Me?

07:19.700 --> 07:23.680
I'm Monkey D. Luffy. Nice to meetcha!

07:31.010 --> 07:33.500
What the... What just happened?

07:33.500 --> 07:35.300
What's with them?

07:35.900 --> 07:40.010
R-Run, hurry! If they come back 
with their friends, you'll be killed!

07:40.010 --> 07:42.400
But man, I sure am hungry!

07:42.400 --> 07:45.210
How can you be so carefree?!

07:45.210 --> 07:48.500
There are still lots 
more of them up on deck!

07:48.500 --> 07:51.580
C'mon! This way!

07:51.580 --> 07:55.910
H-H-Hey! Not this way!

08:00.620 --> 08:04.360
Food! Food! Food! Yes! Food!

08:04.360 --> 08:08.590
Actually, they might 
not find us in here!

08:09.100 --> 08:12.550
Which should I choose? 
This box? Ooh, jackpot!

08:12.550 --> 08:14.600
These look {great}tasty!

08:14.600 --> 08:18.690
M-My name is Koby. 
You're Luffy-<i>san</i>, right?

08:18.690 --> 08:21.560
That was incredible just now! 
How did you do that?!

08:22.210 --> 08:23.520
These things are great!

08:25.090 --> 08:26.910
Is this a pirate ship?

08:26.910 --> 08:33.910
No, it's a passenger ship that's 
being plundered by Alvida-<i>sama</i>.

08:33.910 --> 08:35.710
{Well, it doesn't matter.}Makes no difference to me.

08:35.710 --> 08:37.890
Know if there are 
any boats on board?

08:37.890 --> 08:40.200
I-I think so...

08:40.200 --> 08:43.010
My ship got swallowed 
by this giant whirlpool!

08:43.010 --> 08:46.500
You mean <i>that</i> whirlpool?! 
No one could survive that!

08:46.500 --> 08:49.960
Boy, was that a real surprise!

08:51.400 --> 08:54.050
{Are you one of those pirates, too?}Are you one of those pirates too?

08:58.900 --> 09:01.970
It was on that fateful day...

09:02.540 --> 09:08.200
That day, I got in a boat on 
the outskirts of town to go fishing,

09:13.320 --> 09:19.790
but it turned out the boat 
was actually headed for a pirate ship.

09:19.790 --> 09:21.490
It's been two years now.

09:21.490 --> 09:25.990
In exchange for my life, 
{I've been forced to be a cabin boy.}I was forced to work as a cabin boy.

09:25.990 --> 09:28.400
Man, you're {dumb and stupid!}a real idiot!

09:28.400 --> 09:30.290
You're brutally honest.

09:30.290 --> 09:31.840
If you don't like it, 
then run away!

09:31.840 --> 09:34.300
I-I can't! No way! No way!

09:34.300 --> 09:36.330
Just the thought of Alvida-<i>sama</i> finding me...

09:36.330 --> 09:38.540
{frightens me and }makes me weak in the knees.

09:38.540 --> 09:41.010
Oh, you're a wimp too?

09:41.010 --> 09:44.310
{Man, I hate you!}I hate people like you!

09:45.470 --> 09:48.270
Hey, now! Quit {dawdling!}slackin' off!

09:48.270 --> 09:51.020
Haul it all over before 
the Navy gets here!

09:51.990 --> 09:54.690
Anyone caught dawdling 
gets a taste of my iron mace!

09:54.690 --> 09:55.950
{- }What a haul!{ 
- Seems like a pretty rich ship!}

09:54.700 --> 09:55.950
Anyone caught dawdling 
gets a taste of my iron mace!

10:01.800 --> 10:03.080
Alvida-<i>sama </i>!

10:04.290 --> 10:05.750
Bad news!

10:05.750 --> 10:07.210
What is it?! You're tickin' me off!

10:07.210 --> 10:09.500
A b-b-barrel!

10:09.500 --> 10:10.530
Monster!

10:10.530 --> 10:11.460
Huh?!

10:13.210 --> 10:15.420
Who're you calling a monster?!

10:22.810 --> 10:27.640
N-No... Some weird guy 
popped out of a barrel...

10:27.640 --> 10:31.310
He might be... a bounty hunter...

10:31.310 --> 10:32.940
What?!

10:33.810 --> 10:37.300
Yeah. That's right.

10:37.300 --> 10:41.490
{If only I had the courage 
to drift the ocean in a barrel...}If only I had the kind of courage 
to drift the seas in a barrel...

10:41.490 --> 10:44.750
{there's actually something 
I want to do, too...}You see, there's something 
I really want to do.

10:45.530 --> 10:50.290
Umm... What compelled you 
to set out to sea, Luffy-<i>san </i>?

10:50.850 --> 10:53.090
I'm gonna be 
king of the pirates!

10:55.210 --> 10:57.890
K-K-King of the pirates?!

10:57.270 --> 10:57.890
Yep.

10:57.890 --> 10:59.500
Are you serious?!

10:58.790 --> 10:59.500
Yeah.

10:59.500 --> 11:02.300
Wait, you're a pirate, Luffy-<i>san </i>?!

11:02.300 --> 11:03.200
Yep.

11:03.200 --> 11:04.360
Your crew?

11:04.360 --> 11:06.470
Don't got one. 
{I'm just 
about to look for one.}I'm looking though.

11:11.690 --> 11:14.240
Th-Th-The king of the pirates 
is the person...

11:14.240 --> 11:16.980
who obtains everything 
this world has to offer!

11:16.980 --> 11:20.910
The great treasure of wealth, fame, and power...

11:20.910 --> 11:23.630
One Piece!

11:23.630 --> 11:24.500
Yup!

11:24.500 --> 11:28.510
"Yup"?! Pirates all over the world 
are after that treasure!

11:28.510 --> 11:29.580
Me too!

11:29.580 --> 11:33.410
No way! No way, no way, 
no way! Absolutely no way!

11:33.410 --> 11:37.200
There's no way you can reach 
the summit of this Great Pirate Era!

11:37.200 --> 11:38.620
No way! No way!

11:40.480 --> 11:42.740
Why did you hit me?

11:42.740 --> 11:44.080
{Just because.}Felt like it.

11:44.800 --> 11:47.660
But it's all right. 
I'm used to it now...

11:51.500 --> 11:54.000
It's not about whether 
I reach it or not.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.560
I'm gonna do it 
because I wanna.

11:58.150 --> 12:01.790
I've decided to be 
the king of the pirates,

12:01.790 --> 12:05.120
so if I die fighting for that, 
that's fine with me!

12:08.120 --> 12:12.300
Now, then! I'm stuffed! 
Guess I'll go get me a boat!

12:12.300 --> 12:13.890
I wonder if they'll give me one{ if I ask}.

12:13.890 --> 12:16.310
Hopefully they're generous.

12:17.180 --> 12:19.840
{I never once thought about it...}I never gave it that much thought...

12:21.220 --> 12:24.010
Do you think 
I could do it, too?

12:24.010 --> 12:25.900
If I'm prepared to die for it?

12:25.900 --> 12:26.890
Do what?

12:27.540 --> 12:31.440
Do you think... 
I could join the Navy?

12:32.180 --> 12:33.080
Navy?

12:33.080 --> 12:36.900
Yes! Catching bad guys is my dream!

12:36.900 --> 12:41.000
It's been my dream ever since 
I was little! Do you think I can do it?!

12:41.000 --> 12:42.500
How should I know?

12:42.500 --> 12:45.790
No! I'll do it! {If I'm gonna be 
a chore boy for the rest of my life,}I won't be a cabin boy for the rest of my life!

12:45.790 --> 12:51.330
{then I'll break out of here}One day I'll break free, join up and 
catch Alvida-<i>sama </i>! No, Alvida!

12:57.050 --> 13:02.300
{You're gonna team up 
with him to catch who?!}Join up? With this guy?
To catch who exactly?!

13:02.300 --> 13:05.390
Huh, Koby?!

13:23.200 --> 13:25.900
You don't look like 
Pirate Hunter Zoro.

13:26.820 --> 13:27.800
Zoro?

13:27.800 --> 13:29.370
Koby!

13:29.370 --> 13:33.670
On these seas, who's the fairest of 'em all?!

13:34.830 --> 13:36.790
O-Of course that would be–

13:37.450 --> 13:39.250
Who's this fat old lady?

13:45.690 --> 13:47.680
– Fat? 
– {Not good}He said it–

13:50.470 --> 13:53.640
You runt!

13:56.760 --> 13:57.560
Let's go!

14:05.820 --> 14:07.290
Why, you...

14:13.870 --> 14:15.830
Whoops!

14:27.630 --> 14:31.300
It's not fair to attack from behind!

14:37.810 --> 14:42.480
It's not fair to {attack all at once!}gang up on people!

14:51.850 --> 14:52.780
Gotcha!

14:54.660 --> 14:58.640
Rubber Rubber...

15:01.550 --> 15:04.950
Rocket!

15:05.670 --> 15:07.420
What?!

15:12.460 --> 15:15.630
L-Luffy-<i>san</i>... What are you?

15:15.630 --> 15:16.220
Me?

15:17.070 --> 15:18.680
I'm a rubber man!

15:19.330 --> 15:23.190
A rubber man? 
You can't be serious!

15:26.270 --> 15:28.940
You've eaten a devil fruit, 
haven't you?

15:29.800 --> 15:31.860
Yeah! The Rubber Rubber Fruit!

15:31.860 --> 15:34.410
Ah, so you're a pirate too?!

15:34.920 --> 15:39.120
Then that means you 
and me are enemies, huh?

15:39.720 --> 15:42.490
L-Luffy-<i>san </i>! Let's get out of here!

15:41.690 --> 15:42.490
Why?

15:42.490 --> 15:44.870
You saw how powerful her mace is!

15:44.870 --> 15:48.090
In these waters, she's
the number one–

15:50.300 --> 15:53.600
<i>I've decided to be 
the king of the pirates,</i>

15:53.600 --> 15:57.010
<i>so if I die fighting for that, 
that's fine with me!</i>

16:00.020 --> 16:02.810
I'm the number one what?!

16:02.810 --> 16:05.560
T-T-The...

16:06.360 --> 16:12.240
The number one ugliest, 
fattest, oldest hag ever!

16:24.500 --> 16:26.080
What did you say?!

16:26.750 --> 16:29.100
I...I'm gonna join the Navy!

16:29.100 --> 16:31.910
And then I'll {beat up pirates}give you pirates hell!

16:31.910 --> 16:34.600
Do ya even know what yer sayin'?!

16:34.600 --> 16:38.100
I do! I'm gonna do 
what I wanna do!

16:38.100 --> 16:40.100
When I'm... 
When I'm a marine...

16:40.100 --> 16:43.270
I'll catch your lousy ass!

16:43.270 --> 16:45.800
You damn pipsqueak!

16:45.800 --> 16:50.300
No regrets! No regrets! 
I said it! I fought... for my dream!

16:50.300 --> 16:51.400
Well said!

17:04.000 --> 17:05.290
That won't work!

17:05.290 --> 17:06.500
What?!

17:06.500 --> 17:08.040
'Cause I'm rubber!

17:10.420 --> 17:14.370
Rubber Rubber...

17:15.700 --> 17:21.140
Pistol!

17:39.060 --> 17:41.910
The sky is so blue...

17:53.380 --> 17:54.490
Hey!

17:54.490 --> 17:55.300
– Yes?!
– Yes?!

17:56.000 --> 17:58.250
Give Koby a small boat!

17:58.250 --> 18:01.600
He's gonna join the Navy!
So just let him go quietly.

18:02.390 --> 18:04.060
– R-Right!
– R-Right!

18:05.810 --> 18:07.450
Luffy-<i>san </i>!

18:14.200 --> 18:16.390
It's the Navy!

18:16.390 --> 18:20.490
Oh, perfect timing! 
You should go see 'em!

18:20.490 --> 18:22.190
But I'm a pirate! I'm outta here!

18:22.190 --> 18:23.300
Seriously?!

18:23.300 --> 18:25.240
I can't just join 
the Navy like this!

18:25.240 --> 18:27.320
I'll be captured instead!

18:39.800 --> 18:42.050
Looks like we managed to get away...

18:42.050 --> 18:45.300
Whew, that was fun!

18:45.300 --> 18:47.590
Umm, Luffy-<i>san</i>.

18:47.590 --> 18:49.710
If you're looking for the One Piece,

18:49.710 --> 18:52.880
that means you're heading to the Grand Line, right?

18:52.300 --> 18:52.880
Yeah.

18:52.880 --> 18:56.090
That place is also referred to 
as a pirate graveyard, you know.

18:56.090 --> 18:58.900
Yeah. So I'll need a strong crew.

18:59.410 --> 19:02.740
What about that Pirate Hunter guy? 
What's he like?

19:03.310 --> 19:08.500
You mean Zoro? I heard he's being 
held prisoner at a naval base.

19:08.500 --> 19:10.410
Oh? He's a weakling?

19:10.410 --> 19:15.580
Nothing of the sort! 
He's as terrifying as a demon!

19:16.950 --> 19:18.840
Why are you asking about him?

19:19.900 --> 19:22.800
If he's a good guy, I thought 
he could join my crew!

19:24.180 --> 19:26.300
You're being reckless again!

19:26.300 --> 19:28.210
C'mon, he might be a good guy!

19:28.210 --> 19:30.410
He was caught 
<i>because</i> he's a bad guy!

19:30.410 --> 19:34.350
No! No way, no way, no way! 
Absolutely no–

19:34.350 --> 19:36.610
Why did you hit me?

19:36.610 --> 19:37.730
Felt like it!
