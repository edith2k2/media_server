I'm gonna prove it to you!}I’ve had it with you guys! 
You’ll take me seriously after this! {Monkey Derrick Luffy. You're welcome!}

01:04.080 --> 01:07.880
{Yeah, do it! I don't know 
what you're gonna do though!}Get on with it already! 
Whatever it is you’re up to!

01:10.380 --> 01:12.000
Ouch!{!}

01:12.000 --> 01:14.380

01:14.380 --> 01:16.970
{Cheers, guys!}Guys! A toast!

01:17.790 --> 01:22.560
To Luffy's guts and {}to {our great journey}another successful voyage!

01:23.400 --> 01:25.440
{Oh}Uh, it didn't hurt {at all}one bit!

01:25.440 --> 01:27.860
{That's a lie. Don't do such a stupid thing.}Liar. You can’t pull dumb stunts like that.

01:27.860 --> 01:28.940
{It's not a lie!}I'm not lying!

01:28.940 --> 01:31.770
I'm not scared of getting hurt!

{Take}So, take me on your next voyage!
I wanna be a pirate too!

01:37.520 --> 01:39.950

{And I'm good at fighting too}And besides, I'm a good fighter!

01:48.710 --> 01:53.460
{I'm well-trained so my 
punches are like pistols!}I've been training, so now my punch is like a pistol!

{Pistols}A pistol? {Oh, r}Really?

01:56.200 --> 01:57.800
{What's thatS mean}Wanna say that again?!

01:57.800 --> 01:59.180
Luffy!

01:59.180 --> 02:01.720
{You're in such a bad mood!}What's eating you?

02:01.720 --> 02:04.140
{Have fun at whatever you're doing!}You gotta loosen up!

02:04.140 --> 02:06.930
{Yes}Yeah! Being a pirate is {fun}about having fun!

02:06.930 --> 02:09.100
The sea is {broad and vast}boundless!

02:09.100 --> 02:11.560
{We're traveling various islands}There are tons of islands to explore!

02:11.560 --> 02:13.190
{Above all, we're free!}It's all about freedom!

02:14.650 --> 02:18.030
Guys, {don't teach him such silly stuff}stop filling his head with crazy ideas.

02:18.030 --> 02:20.030
But it's {}all true! Right?!

02:20.030 --> 02:23.450
{C'mon, Boss,}C'mon, Boss! {w}Why not {take him on just one voyage}let him tag along sometime? {Gaijin, is he saying "Boss" or something else here?}

02:23.450 --> 02:25.780
{I think so too.}I'd second that.

02:25.780 --> 02:28.250
{Then, somebody, trade places with him.}Sure, but one of you’ll have to stay behind.

02:28.250 --> 02:31.360
{Okay, we're done talking}Good chat, kid! Let's drink! {Gaijin, in the Japanese, do they say "Let's drink!" twice?}

02:31.360 --> 02:32.960
{Didn't you side with me?!}Weren't you on my side?!

02:32.960 --> 02:38.930
{In short, you're too much of a kid.
I'll consider it when you're 10 years older!}You're just too young, kid.
Maybe in ten years I'll give you a chance.

02:38.930 --> 02:41.680
{Stupid Shanks! I'm not a kid!}C'mon, Shanks! I'm not a little kid!

02:41.680 --> 02:44.300
{Now, now. Don't get so mad.
Have some juice!}Hey now. Simmer down and have some juice.

02:44.300 --> 02:46.360
{Wow}Oh! Thanks!

02:47.560 --> 02:51.480
– See{,}! {y}You <i>are</i> {}just a kid!{ Ha!}
– {That wasn't fair}That's a dirty trick, Shanks!

02:52.480 --> 02:54.500
{I'm tired now!}I'm so sick of this! {Zenef&Feeso: Nap time?}

02:54.500 --> 02:58.220
{Luffy, you gotta try 
to understand how Boss feels.}Luffy, try to understand 
where the boss is coming from.

02:58.220 --> 02:58.990
First mate!

02:59.920 --> 03:03.420
{There's no denying that he's 
the head of a pirate group.}He's the head of a pirate crew, you see?

03:03.420 --> 03:07.370
{He knows how tough and dangerous
being a pirate is more than anybody.}He knows the challenges and risks 
that come with being a pirate.

03:07.370 --> 03:11.920
You get it? 
{It's not like 
he wants to break your spirit.}He's not trying to crush your dream.

03:11.920 --> 03:16.630
{No, I don't!
Shanks is just making fun of me!}No, I <i>don't</i> get it! 
Shanks just likes making fun of me!

03:16.630 --> 03:18.630
– Anchor!
– See?!

03:18.630 --> 03:20.990
I {guess}see you're having fun as usual.

03:20.990 --> 03:24.800
{Yeah, I like teasing him.}Yeah, I love teasing this kid.

03:24.800 --> 03:27.810
Luffy, {do you wanna eat something too}would you like something to eat too?

03:27.810 --> 03:30.390
{Uh-huh}Yeah! Put it on my treasure tab!

03:30.390 --> 03:34.470
{The treasure tab again?
That's fraud, you know?}Treasure tab? Sounds like a scam to me.

03:34.470 --> 03:39.070
{No, it's not! Once I become a pirate 
and find a treasure, I'll pay for it!}Is not!{I'm gonna become a pirate,
find lots of treasure, and pay her back!} I'll pay her back with 
the treasure I find when I'm a pirate!

03:39.940 --> 03:41.680
I'm counting on it.

03:43.300 --> 03:44.370
Shanks.

03:44.370 --> 03:45.290
{What?}What's up?

03:45.290 --> 03:47.980
How much longer are you 
gonna {stay in}dock at this village?

03:47.980 --> 03:51.400
Let's see... {We're gonna go 
on a couple of voyages}After a couple more voyages...

03:51.400 --> 03:55.110
{then}we'll leave this village {to head north}for good and head north.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.010
A couple {of}more voyages, huh?

04:02.510 --> 04:05.390
{I'll practice swimming while you're here!}Then I'll learn to swim before you leave!

04:05.390 --> 04:08.310
{That's good}Sure thing. Knock yourself out.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.850
Pardon us.

04:14.850 --> 04:19.400
{So these are "pirates."
Look pretty damn dumb.}So, <i>these</i> are pirates. 
Looks like a sorry bunch to me.

04:28.620 --> 04:33.990
We're mountain bandits.
But we ain't here to {tear}bust up the place.

04:33.990 --> 04:35.290
{Sell us}We'd like some booze.

04:35.290 --> 04:38.920
{I'm sorry}I'm sorry, sir. I just ran out of alcohol. {Feeso: Added "sir" to go for a restaurant feel.}

04:39.990 --> 04:44.010
{These pirates seem to be drinking 
something... What is it, water?}Then what are these pirates drinking? Water?

04:44.010 --> 04:47.640
{No, what they're drinking is the last of it.}I'm afraid I served the last of it to them.

04:47.640 --> 04:53.700
{My apologies}I'm real sorry.
Looks like we drank the whole place dry.

04:53.700 --> 04:54.600
{Sorry!}Our bad.

04:55.490 --> 04:58.860
You can have this.
It hasn't been opened yet.

05:06.780 --> 05:11.390
{Hey, you bastard!
Who do you think I am?}Is that a joke, wise guy?!
Just who do you take me for?

05:11.390 --> 05:14.710
One bottle ain't even 
enough for a {bedtime drink}nightcap!

05:16.720 --> 05:18.250
{The floor's all wet!}It's all over the floor.

05:18.250 --> 05:19.490
{Look at this.}Take a look.

05:19.490 --> 05:22.380
{There's an eight million belly 
bounty on my head.}My head’s worth eight million belly.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.720
I've killed {56}fifty-six people.
{They were all impudent like you.}All of ‘em comedians like you. {Feeso&Zenef: Comedian ties into the joke line}

05:27.720 --> 05:30.190
{So be careful hereafter.}You'd better watch yourself. {I have the death sentence on 12 systems!}

05:30.190 --> 05:31.520
{But, since we're in the mountains}We're mountain folk.

05:31.520 --> 05:34.080
{and you're on the sea, I don't think we'll see each other again.}Stick to the sea; the land is our turf. {Zenef&Feeso: Our best interpretation.}

05:36.270 --> 05:39.800
Sorry about {that}the mess, Makino-<i>san </i>.
Do you have a rag?

05:39.800 --> 05:42.850
{Oh, I'll do that!}No! Leave that to me!

05:50.070 --> 05:54.950
Seems you like to clean.
Then maybe you'll find <i>this</i> more fulfilling.

06:08.900 --> 06:11.300
{Later, wimps!}Later, cowards!

06:17.940 --> 06:20.100
Captain{-san}, are you all right?{Zenef: Captain-san is redundant}

06:20.100 --> 06:21.980
Oh{,}. {no problem at all}No worries.

06:26.500 --> 06:30.530
– Talk about lame, Boss!
– He got you good!

06:32.490 --> 06:34.990
{Why are you laughing}You think it's funny?!

06:34.990 --> 06:39.010
{That was so uncool}That was pathetic!
Why didn't you fight {them}back?!

06:39.010 --> 06:44.090
{You're not men - or pirates -
if you laugh after something like that!}You can't call yourself a pirate or even a man
if you laugh after something like that!

06:45.420 --> 06:50.720
{I can understand how you feel}I get where you're coming from,
but he only {spilled}got some booze on me.

06:50.720 --> 06:53.130
{It's nothing worth getting mad over.}There's no need to get bent out of shape.

06:55.390 --> 06:57.220
Hey, wait, Luffy.

06:57.220 --> 06:59.690
I've had it!
I don't wanna be a coward like you!

07:07.780 --> 07:09.280
His arm stretche{s}d!

07:09.280 --> 07:10.950
{Don't tell me you...!}He didn't...!

07:10.950 --> 07:12.530
What's going on?!

07:12.530 --> 07:14.580
– It's gone!
– What?!

07:14.580 --> 07:17.040
The Rubber Rubber Fruit that
we {robbed}stole from our enemy!

07:17.040 --> 07:21.210
{Luffy, don't tell me you ate 
a fruit like this!}Luffy, you didn't eat a fruit like this, did you?!

07:21.210 --> 07:23.790
I-I did... It tasted {so bad}funny.

07:23.790 --> 07:26.810
{The Rubber Rubber Fruit is}That was the Rubber Rubber Fruit! 
{a hidden treasure of the sea}It's a rare treasure of the sea{}...

07:26.810 --> 07:28.300
known as a devil fruit!

07:28.300 --> 07:30.100
Eating it changes your body into rubber...  {"Rubber-like" isn't quite right. He's literally made of rubber now.}

07:30.100 --> 07:33.180
and {makes you lose the ability to
swim}makes you unable 
to swim for the rest of your life! {made it slightly clearer he means the Devil Fruit causes the loss of ability to swim}

07:33.180 --> 07:35.660
Eh?! No way!

07:35.660 --> 07:38.110
You dumbass!{!}

07:41.980 --> 07:44.150
Gimme a fish, old fish shop guy!

07:44.150 --> 07:48.910
Hey, Luffy! I heard {that you didn't 
get to go on a voyage again}
they sailed off without you again!

07:48.910 --> 07:49.780
{That's okay}I don't mind!

07:49.780 --> 07:56.190
{Because I got to become a rubber man!
It's making me way happier than a voyage!}Becoming a rubber man is way cooler than 
going on some dumb voyage.

07:58.290 --> 08:01.660
It's been a while since {}the captain{-san}
and his crew {went on a voyage}set out to sea.

08:01.660 --> 08:03.700
{I bet}Don't you miss them{.}?

08:03.700 --> 08:06.540
{Not at all}Nope! {I haven't forgiven them yet!}I'm still mad at them!

08:06.540 --> 08:10.590
I thought Shanks and the {others}rest 
were {cooler}way awesome pirates!

08:10.590 --> 08:13.520
{Yeah? I think it's cooler to pay no mind}Really? I think it's way more awesome...

08:13.520 --> 08:16.390
{and laugh after someone 
humiliates you like that.}if you can laugh after something like that.

08:16.390 --> 08:18.530
{You don't understand.}Makino, you just don't get it. {He does say Makino's name at the start of the sentence.}

08:18.530 --> 08:21.100
{There are times that men
have to stand up and fight.}There are times when a man's gotta fight.

08:21.100 --> 08:23.140
{I guess I don't understand}Maybe I don't get it.

08:23.140 --> 08:25.310
Make way{ for us}!

08:26.190 --> 08:28.980
{Those damn pirates aren't here today, huh?}Doesn't sound like there're any pirates today, huh?

08:28.980 --> 08:32.110
{We were walking by again so we dropped in.}We were in the area, 
so we decided to drop by.

08:37.880 --> 08:41.160
{Why are you}Don't just stand{ing} there{?}!
{Bring}Get us {}some booze!

08:45.040 --> 08:46.490
Mayor{,}! {we have a problem!}I need your help!

08:46.490 --> 08:47.840
{What is it, Makino?}What's wrong, Makino?

08:47.840 --> 08:50.670
{Luffy's in trouble with mountain bandits!}It's Luffy... and the mountain bandits...!

08:51.840 --> 08:54.130
– Let go! {Let go! Damn}Dammit!
– {What an interesting body...}Weird body y'got here... {Needs to be retimed with secondary style}

08:56.260 --> 08:57.430
{Say you're sorry for that}Apologize already!

08:57.430 --> 08:59.890
– What kind of {animal}creature is he?
– You bastard!

09:03.270 --> 09:06.020
{Damn}Dammit! {I'm gonna make you}You're gonna pay!

09:06.020 --> 09:09.070
{We can sell him for good money.}He might fetch a good price.

09:11.320 --> 09:12.780
{You're so persistent.}How stubborn.

09:12.780 --> 09:14.320
Brat!

09:15.530 --> 09:18.700
Did I say something to offend you?

09:18.700 --> 09:22.620
You did! Now apologize!
Get your foot off of me!

09:22.620 --> 09:24.790
{Let the boy go!}{Let that child alone!}Leave that boy alone!

09:25.700 --> 09:26.670
{Please!}I beg you!

09:27.510 --> 09:31.550
{I don't intend to fight with you!
If you allow it, I'll even pay you!}I have no intention of fighting you, 
but I'm willing to pay.

09:31.550 --> 09:34.720
Spare the boy's life!

09:34.720 --> 09:38.890
Leave it to {}a senior citizen{s} 
to know {how the world works}the way of the world.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.140
But no.

09:42.140 --> 09:46.940
It's too late for {him}that now.
After all, {he's made me angry...}he pissed me off.

09:46.940 --> 09:48.060
{Oh, please}No...

09:48.060 --> 09:52.980
{I'm irritated from being messed 
with by this rubber squirt!}I've had it up to here with this rubber runt!

09:52.980 --> 09:57.150
{You're the bad guys!}You started it! You mountain apes!

09:57.860 --> 10:01.620
{We're not gonna sell him.}Forget selling him.
Let's just kill him!

10:02.580 --> 10:05.120
– Luffy!
– Please! Let him go!

10:11.790 --> 10:14.470
No one came to greet us at the port...

10:16.690 --> 10:18.510
{S}so I {wondered why...}got worried.

10:19.680 --> 10:22.930
– They're the mountain bandits from before.
– Captain{-san}!

10:22.930 --> 10:24.180
Luffy!

10:24.180 --> 10:27.810
I thought your punches
were as strong as pistols?

10:29.000 --> 10:29.980
Shut up!

10:29.980 --> 10:32.610
So you pirates are still here, huh?

10:35.320 --> 10:38.240
You'd best leave before you get hurt.

10:38.240 --> 10:41.950
Any closer and he'll {shoot}blow 
your head off, {wimp}coward.

10:43.910 --> 10:47.790
He said no closer!
Don't make me {blow your head off}pull the trigger!

10:52.370 --> 10:55.900
{Now that}Since you've drawn your pistol,
{put your life on the line.}you're willing to put your life on the line?

10:55.900 --> 10:57.630
{What t}The hell're you talkin' about?

10:57.630 --> 11:01.640
I'm saying those aren't for threat{ening people}s.

11:15.290 --> 11:19.070
– N-Now you've done it!
– These bastards fight dirty!

11:19.070 --> 11:20.400
Dirty?

11:20.400 --> 11:22.340
Cut the crap.

11:22.340 --> 11:24.940
You think you're dealing 
with saints or something?

11:25.590 --> 11:29.000
{You're looking at pirates!}You're staring down a crew of pirates!

11:29.000 --> 11:32.460
Shut up! {You got nothing to do 
with this in the first place!}This is none of your damn business!

11:33.210 --> 11:34.900
Listen, bandits.

11:34.900 --> 11:38.710
{Whether}It doesn't matter if I'm {splattered}doused 
with alcohol or {}covered in food,

11:38.710 --> 11:41.680
most of the time {I'd}I'll just laugh it off.

11:42.500 --> 11:43.590
But...{!}

{anyone who hurts my friends has to pay!}nobody hurts a friend of mine!

11:52.440 --> 11:53.980
Shanks{...}.

11:55.290 --> 11:56.820
{Has to pay, huh?!}Nobody, huh?!

11:56.820 --> 11:59.940
Lousy pirates! Kill 'em, men!

12:04.820 --> 12:06.990
I'll handle this. {Should be easy enough.}Shouldn't be a problem.

12:08.330 --> 12:10.310
Come on! {Come on}Bring it!

12:11.040 --> 12:12.120
{Ouch}That burns!

12:19.410 --> 12:22.380
Don't get cocky, bandit.

12:23.500 --> 12:27.260
{If you wanna fight us,
then go drag a warship here or something.}You'd better bring a battleship 
if you wanna challenge us.

12:28.230 --> 12:29.600
So strong!

12:30.400 --> 12:31.520
Unbelievable{...}.

12:31.520 --> 12:35.230

12:35.230 --> 12:37.610
{You're a wanted man anyway.}Aren't you a wanted man?

12:40.170 --> 12:41.200
A smokescreen! {Rin, smoke screen or smoke bomb?} {It's Smokescreen.}

12:41.200 --> 12:44.030
– Come with me, brat!
– {Let go! Let go!}Let me go! Let me go!

12:46.200 --> 12:47.070
Luffy!

12:47.070 --> 12:50.240
Crap! I let my guard down! Luffy's gone!
What do we do, guys?!

12:50.240 --> 12:54.690
Quit freakin' the hell out, Boss!
It won't take us long to find {him}them!

12:54.690 --> 12:57.420
I can't believe this guy...

12:59.200 --> 13:01.260
I made a clean getaway!

13:01.260 --> 13:04.220
I got no use for you anymore!

13:05.010 --> 13:06.590
You bastard!

13:07.180 --> 13:08.640
{So long}Later!

13:09.150 --> 13:10.810
Dammit! Dammit!

13:10.810 --> 13:17.420
{Those guys are scum, but I couldn't 
even hit them once!} I couldn't do a thing against 
those scumbags! Dammit! Dammit!

13:19.700 --> 13:22.360
<i>You see the looks on those pirates' faces?!</i>

13:22.360 --> 13:24.900
<i>Pirates are {just a bunch of wimps}nothin' but cowards.</i>

13:24.900 --> 13:27.900
<i>{Stop it}Cut that out! 
{Stop making fun 
of}Quit mocking Shanks and the others!</i>

13:27.900 --> 13:28.990
<i>{Stop, Luffy!}Calm down, Luffy!</i>

13:30.450 --> 13:33.910
<i>Stop making fun of Shanks and the others!</i>

13:41.310 --> 13:42.610
{Silly brat.}Stupid kid.

13:48.470 --> 13:49.640
Wh-What the hell?!

13:52.790 --> 13:53.890
Help...!

13:57.560 --> 13:58.810
It's gonna eat me!

14:00.230 --> 14:01.230
Help!

14:15.890 --> 14:17.210
Shanks...

14:25.810 --> 14:27.720
Get lost!

14:49.900 --> 14:55.060
I'm in your debt, Luffy...
Makino-<i>san</i> told me everything.

14:55.060 --> 14:58.210
You {fought}stood up for us.

14:58.940 --> 15:02.170
{Hey}C'mon, don't cry! You're a man, right?

15:03.560 --> 15:06.170
But... Shanks...!

15:07.440 --> 15:09.410
Your arm!

15:12.200 --> 15:15.140
It's only an arm. It's no big deal. {Tis but a flesh wound!}

15:15.900 --> 15:17.760
I'm just glad you're {alright...}not hurt. {Zenef&Feeso: "not hurt" referring back to his speech earlier}

15:27.900 --> 15:31.490
<i>Luffy {learned the reason that}finally understood {why}the reason 
Shanks {didn't take}never took him on a voyage:</i>

15:31.490 --> 15:34.800
<i>{the harshness of the sea,
his powerlessness,}the sea was harsh, and he was powerless.</i>

15:34.800 --> 15:38.850
<i>{and most}But most importantly,
{the man named Shanks' greatness.}he discovered the man's greatness.</i>

15:38.850 --> 15:43.420
<i>{He truly thought that he wanted to
become a man like him someday.}He aspired to be like him one day.</i>

15:46.400 --> 15:49.670

15:49.670 --> 15:54.010
{No}Nah. {It was a long stay, 
but now we part ways.}We were able to stay awhile, 
but it's time to part ways.

15:54.010 --> 15:58.000
{Yeah, I won't ask you to take me anymore.}Right. I'm not gonna ask you 
to take me this time.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.480
I've decided to become a pirate on my own{ now}!

16:01.480 --> 16:03.520
I wasn't gonna take you anyway!

16:04.300 --> 16:06.770
{You'll never be a pirate!}You'd never make it as a pirate!

16:06.770 --> 16:08.000

{Someday, I'm gonna gather 
a crew every bit as good as yours,}Someday, I'm gonna have 
a crew better than yours,

and {I'm gonna}we'll find the {greatest treasure in the world}world's greatest treasure,

16:14.110 --> 16:17.450
{and}then I'm gonna be {the }king of the pirates!

16:18.370 --> 16:22.270
Oh? You're gonna surpass us, huh?

16:24.110 --> 16:25.580
In that case...

16:28.500 --> 16:31.450
I'll leave this hat with you.

16:37.790 --> 16:40.510
It's dear to me.

16:42.850 --> 16:47.810
{Come bring it back to me someday!
Once you've become a great pirate!}Give it back to me someday, 
once you've become a great pirate!

16:50.530 --> 16:52.690
He's got quite a future.

16:52.690 --> 16:56.620
{Yeah, he's so much like the kid I used to be.}Yeah. He reminds me of when I was a kid.

16:57.460 --> 16:59.660
Set sail!

<i>{Then a decade later, the boy's 
adventure started at the same port.}Luffy's voyage would begin 
ten years later from this very port. {TheFVguy: use "voyage" to reference Luffy's insistence on going on voyage with Shanks}</i>

17:08.670 --> 17:11.760
10 Years Later

{What a nice day for setting sail!}What a nice day to set sail!

{Here comes our local Sea Monster}Well if it isn't the Lord of the Coast!

{Look at this technique
I've been training for 10 years!}Here's a technique ten years in the making!
