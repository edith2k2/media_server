02:33.930 --> 02:36.410
He's no ordinary human,
that straw hat.

02:36.410 --> 02:40.040
Must've eaten one of those
rumored devil fruits!

02:40.040 --> 02:43.430
– A devil fruit?!
– The {hidden treasures}secret treasure of the sea?!

02:45.120 --> 02:47.040
The devil fruits...

02:47.040 --> 02:52.430
Whoever eats one is said to gain
seemingly {unworldly}otherworldly abilities.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.700
The power to breathe fire...

02:55.700 --> 02:58.010
The power to cause tsunamis...

02:58.010 --> 03:00.100
There are all sorts of rumors,

03:00.100 --> 03:04.060
but there are many types, and
almost nothing is known about them.

03:04.060 --> 03:07.700
{It's said the secrets to
them lie in the Grand Line...}Some say their secrets 
lie in the Grand Line...

03:09.000 --> 03:13.670
{but there's no question Straw Hat 
just displayed a devil power!}but there's no room for doubt; 
straw hat has the power of the devil!

03:13.670 --> 03:15.230
Hurry! Hurry!

03:15.230 --> 03:19.130
Damn! These knots are tight!

03:17.600 --> 03:19.130
Hey! Quit wastin' time!

03:19.130 --> 03:21.220
No matter who {they are}you are,

03:21.220 --> 03:23.880
{everyone who opposes
me gets executed!}if you defy me, 
then you die!

03:23.880 --> 03:26.100
If guns won't work,
then {chop}slice them to death!

03:30.480 --> 03:33.150
Huh, that's weird!
It got tighter instead!

03:33.150 --> 03:34.690
{Give me a damn sword!}Dammit! Swords! Now!

03:38.030 --> 03:38.990
Luffy-<i>san </i>!

03:47.830 --> 03:49.950
Roronoa Zoro!

03:51.330 --> 03:52.540
So cool!

03:53.920 --> 03:55.920
{Move and you're dead}If you move, you die.

03:56.900 --> 03:58.710
He's too scary!

04:02.690 --> 04:05.800
I'll be a pirate.
I promise you that.

04:05.800 --> 04:09.610
{I'm officially a criminal,
now that I've fought the Navy.}Now that I've fought the Navy, 
I'm officially an outlaw.

04:09.610 --> 04:12.320
{But I'll tell you this right now.}But let's get one thing straight.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.880
{I'm only going to
fulfill my ambition!}I'm only in it to 
accomplish my dream.

04:14.880 --> 04:15.650
{Ambition}Dream?

04:15.650 --> 04:19.390
To be the world's
greatest swordsman!

04:19.390 --> 04:22.530
{If I wind up having
to give that up,}So if you ever make 
me abandon my dream,

04:22.530 --> 04:26.660
{you'd better accept responsibility
and apologize to me!}you'll need to commit <i>harakiri</i> 
to earn my forgiveness!

04:26.660 --> 04:30.400
The world's greatest swordsman?
{That sounds great}I like it!

04:30.400 --> 04:34.120
{The pirate king would need
no less than that on his crew!}That's exactly the person 
the pirate king needs on his crew!

04:35.020 --> 04:36.210
You sure talk big.

04:36.210 --> 04:39.180
At this point, 
{whether it's as
a criminal or whatever else,}whether it's in fame or infamy,

04:39.180 --> 04:41.760
{I will spread my name
throughout the world!}the world's gonna know my name!

04:41.760 --> 04:46.300
What're you standing around for?!
Slaughter them this instant!

04:47.720 --> 04:49.560
Duck, Zoro!

04:50.310 --> 04:54.350
Rubber Rubber Whip!

04:56.880 --> 04:59.680
Y-You did it! Incredible!

04:59.680 --> 05:01.320
What the hell are you?

05:01.840 --> 05:04.280
I ate the Rubber Rubber Fruit.

05:04.280 --> 05:06.030
Rubber Rubber Fruit?

05:06.030 --> 05:07.930
A rubber person!

05:07.930 --> 05:10.390
So he <i>does</i> have devil fruit powers!

05:10.390 --> 05:12.760
Captain! We don't stand
a chance against them!

05:12.760 --> 05:14.240
These guys are {crazy}too much!

05:14.240 --> 05:16.420
We can't even handle
Zoro by himself!

05:19.000 --> 05:20.830
This is {a direct}an order!

05:20.830 --> 05:22.860
{Everyone who spouted
weakness just now...}Every weakling whining just now...

05:22.860 --> 05:24.780
{must now shoot themselves
in the head!}must shoot himself in the head!

05:24.780 --> 05:28.220
{I have no need for
weakling soldiers!}I won't tolerate cowardice 
among my men!

05:30.430 --> 05:33.220
{These troops are mental!}Something's seriously off 
about these troops!

05:33.220 --> 05:35.020
Luffy-<i>san </i>!

05:37.150 --> 05:39.650
{Crush this Navy!}Beat the crap out of this Navy!

05:48.530 --> 05:53.310
{Rankless, low-status bums have
no right whatsoever to defy me!}Those without rank nor status 
should know their place!

05:53.310 --> 05:57.200
{I am Navy captain
"Axe-Hand" Morgan!}I am Captain "Axe-Hand" Morgan 
of the Navy!

05:57.200 --> 05:59.710
I'm Luffy!
Nice to meetcha!

06:00.090 --> 06:02.210
Die!

06:11.180 --> 06:12.970
T-The captain!

06:12.970 --> 06:15.600
{R-runt...}Y-You puny...

06:17.640 --> 06:18.730
Die!

06:19.580 --> 06:20.770
No thanks!

06:23.670 --> 06:25.450
C-Captain Morgan is...

06:27.750 --> 06:29.200
{being trounced completely...}He's getting thrashed!

06:30.780 --> 06:32.810
And you call yourself a marine?!

06:32.810 --> 06:36.330
{You've destroyed Koby's dream!}You're ruining Koby's dream!

06:36.330 --> 06:39.670
Hold it, straw hat!
{Check this out!}Look over here!

06:41.450 --> 06:44.080
I said hold it!
Are you stupid?!

06:44.080 --> 06:47.050
{Pay attention!
I have a hostage here!}Are you blind?! 
I've taken a hostage!

06:47.050 --> 06:48.880
Helmeppo-<i>sama </i>!

06:49.600 --> 06:52.580
If you value this guy's life, 
don't move!

06:52.580 --> 06:55.850
One move and I'll shoot!

07:00.710 --> 07:04.700
Luffy-<i>san </i>! {I don't want
to get in your way!}Don't stop 
on my account!

07:04.700 --> 07:08.150
– {Even if it means dying}Even if he kills me!
 – Yeah, I know!

07:08.150 --> 07:10.290
{Give it up}It's no use, idiot son!

07:10.290 --> 07:12.480
{Koby really is ready to die!}Seems Koby's ready to die.

07:13.570 --> 07:15.220
Don't move!

07:15.220 --> 07:17.540
I told you not to move!
I-I'll shoot!

07:18.910 --> 07:20.260
Behind you!

07:20.260 --> 07:21.520
Rubber Rubber...

07:21.520 --> 07:25.960
{I am Navy captain
"Axe-Hand" Morgan!}I am Captain "Axe-Hand" Morgan 
of the Navy!

07:27.100 --> 07:30.420
{Dad}Daddy! Kill him, quick!

07:28.500 --> 07:30.420
Pistol!

07:34.850 --> 07:36.310
Nice!

07:45.400 --> 07:46.230
Zoro.

07:46.810 --> 07:50.240
{My pleasure}It was my pleasure, Captain.

07:57.400 --> 07:58.860
{Captain Morgan's been beaten!}Captain Morgan lost!

07:58.860 --> 08:01.200
– Unbelievable!
– These guys are insane!

08:02.830 --> 08:06.790
{If anyone else still wants
to catch us, come forward!}If any of you still wanna 
try your luck, bring it on!

08:09.640 --> 08:12.930
– Hooray!
– We're free!

08:12.930 --> 08:15.720
– Yahoo!
– Morgan's reign is over!

08:15.720 --> 08:17.890
{Hooray for the Navy!}For the Navy! Hooray!

08:17.890 --> 08:22.030
{Huh? Everyone's happy their
captain's been beaten...}What gives? Why are they so happy 
we beat their captain?

08:22.030 --> 08:25.350
{Everyone was just
afraid of Morgan!}Everyone was in fact 
just <i>afraid</i> of Morgan!

08:29.650 --> 08:32.780
What's wrong, Zoro-<i>san </i>?!
Are you hurt?!

08:32.780 --> 08:35.610
I'm... hungry...

08:40.960 --> 08:42.580
I'm stuffed!

08:42.580 --> 08:47.540
{I was definitely at my rope's end, having not eaten for three weeks!}Three weeks with no food put me 
in worse shape than I thought!

08:51.200 --> 08:53.760
Huh? You're finished already?

08:54.500 --> 08:57.470
{How the heck can you have}How the hell do you have
a bigger appetite than me?!

08:57.470 --> 09:00.040
It tastes good! Right, Koby?

09:00.040 --> 09:02.980
{Thank you for treating
me to food too.}It's awfully kind of you 
to treat me as well.

09:02.980 --> 09:06.440
It's no {problem}trouble! 
{The town has been saved, after all!}You saved our town, after all!

09:06.440 --> 09:09.260
{You really are amazing!}You're really great, mister!

09:09.260 --> 09:12.480
{Yep, I am! And I'm gonna
be even more amazing!}Yeah, I'm great! 
And I'm gonna be even greater!

09:12.480 --> 09:15.240
{'Cause }After all, I'm gonna be
king of the pirates!

09:15.240 --> 09:17.280
{And I even have a crew!}And now I've got a crew!

09:17.280 --> 09:20.870
So, how many others have you
gathered besides me?

09:22.900 --> 09:26.490
You said you were in the middle of 
{gathering a crew.}putting together a crew.

09:26.490 --> 09:30.780
{To be king of the pirates, you must have a good number gathered.}I bet you got a sizable crew if you're 
gonna be king of the pirates.

09:30.780 --> 09:31.840
Oh? {Just you.}You're the first.

09:31.840 --> 09:34.220
Huh?! Then...

09:34.220 --> 09:36.220
Yep! Just us two!

09:36.220 --> 09:39.250
{We're gonna call just
us two a pirate crew?!}Can just two people even be 
considered a pirate crew?!

09:39.250 --> 09:41.630
{What's wrong with that?
We are strong!}I don't see why not! 
We're tough!

09:41.630 --> 09:44.180
{What about a ship?
Where's your pirate ship?}And a ship?
Where's your pirate ship?

09:44.180 --> 09:45.390
There.

09:52.320 --> 09:57.070
I think Luffy-<i>san</i> was born
without {any sense of planning}a shred of foresight.

09:57.070 --> 10:00.740
Did I really make this
guy my captain?!

10:00.740 --> 10:03.780
Well, we'll get more
crew members {before long}soon!

10:03.780 --> 10:08.230
Hey, hey! Where are 
you guys gonna go {to }now?

10:08.230 --> 10:11.590
Isn't it obvious?!
The Grand Line!

10:13.080 --> 10:15.290
{You still only have two members!}There are only the two of you!

10:15.290 --> 10:17.450
There's no way you can go there!

10:17.450 --> 10:18.740
No way! No way! No way!

10:18.740 --> 10:21.760
Is the Grand Line that
{terrible}bad of a place?

10:21.760 --> 10:23.730
{Naturally!}You bet it is!

10:23.730 --> 10:28.150
You know this world
has two oceans, right?

10:28.150 --> 10:32.710
{And the giant continent that cuts
them right in two is the Red Line.}And how there's a giant landmass 
called the Red Line separating them?

10:32.710 --> 10:36.010
Supposedly, {there's a town right
in the middle of the Red Line,}a town sits smack dab 
in the middle of the Red Line,

10:36.010 --> 10:40.540
and the Grand Line 
{goes
through it at a right angle...}intersects the town at a right angle...

10:40.540 --> 10:43.720
{and stretches around the world.}and stretches all the way 
around the world.

10:43.720 --> 10:47.000
{It was said that 
Pirate King Gold Roger}They say that 
Pirate King Gold Roger...

10:47.000 --> 10:51.130
{once }obtained everything this world 
has to offer, and before he died,

10:51.130 --> 10:56.920
{he said he left
the great One Piece treasure there,}he said it's there in the Grand Line
–the great treasure One Piece–

10:56.920 --> 11:00.650
{so pirates everywhere have since
set sail for the Grand Line!}and now pirates from all over 
set sail to those seas!

11:00.650 --> 11:07.230
{It's now an intense battlefield,
and even called a pirate graveyard!}It's become an intense battlefield,
known to many as a pirate graveyard!

11:10.710 --> 11:13.280
I've heard from patrons before...

11:13.280 --> 11:17.360
that whoever enters the Grand Line 
never {comes out}returns alive.

11:17.360 --> 11:21.610
{But the One Piece
is somewhere there,}But the One Piece 
is in there somewhere,

11:21.610 --> 11:22.570
so we're going{ there}!

11:22.570 --> 11:24.530
{Guess it can't be helped!}Okay! No way around it!

11:24.530 --> 11:26.610
{Not you too, Zoro-san?!}Zoro-<i>san </i>! Even you?!

11:26.610 --> 11:28.600
{What's it matter?
You're not going, are you?}You're staying here, 
so why the fuss?

11:28.600 --> 11:31.900
{N-no, but I'm worried about you!}T-That's because I'm worried about you!

11:31.900 --> 11:33.500
Is that so wrong?!

11:33.500 --> 11:36.900
{Luffy-san and I haven't
known each other long,}I realize Luffy-<i>san</i> and I 
haven't known each other long,

11:36.900 --> 11:38.400
{but we are friends!}but we've become friends!

11:38.400 --> 11:39.510
{Right?}Am I right?

11:39.510 --> 11:43.510
Yeah! We're gonna part ways,
but we'll always be friends!

11:46.890 --> 11:51.100
Since I was little kid,
{I've never had friends...}I could never make friends...

11:51.100 --> 11:54.900
{Much less anyone who would
fight for my sake...}much less find anyone 
willing to fight for my sake...

11:54.900 --> 11:58.980
{But more than anything, 
I never tried to fight for anything.}I mean, really, <i>I've</i> never truly fought for anything.

12:00.960 --> 12:06.270
But you two taught me 
how to live for my beliefs!

12:06.270 --> 12:09.590
{I've decided to make
my childhood dream come true!}I've decided I'll make 
my childhood dream a reality!

12:09.590 --> 12:11.370
I want to join the Navy!

12:11.370 --> 12:14.670
Shouldn't you be more
worried about yourself, then?

12:16.560 --> 12:18.260
{Even if you were
just a chore boy,}Sure, you were 
just a cabin boy,

12:18.260 --> 12:21.590
{you did spend two years
on Alvida's pirate ship.}but you spent two years 
on Alvida's pirate ship.

12:23.970 --> 12:26.500
{Don't underestimate the Navy's
info-gathering skills.}The Navy's intelligence 
is nothing to scoff at.

12:26.500 --> 12:29.390
{If they find out about that,
you'll never get to join.}If they learn about your past, 
they wont let you enlist.

12:29.900 --> 12:32.480
N-Now that you mention it...

12:32.480 --> 12:34.020
Pardon me!

12:39.830 --> 12:42.490
Is it true that you are pirates?!

12:42.490 --> 12:47.740
{Yeah. We gained a member
and became a pirate group just now!}Yeah! Got my first member, 
so we're officially a pirate crew now!

12:47.740 --> 12:53.530
We appreciate that you saved our 
base and this town from that tyrant!

12:53.530 --> 12:56.420
{However, now that we know
you are pirates,}However, after confirming 
you are indeed pirates,

12:56.420 --> 13:00.000
in the name of the Navy,
{we cannot stand by quietly!}we cannot idly stand by!

13:00.000 --> 13:03.210
You will leave this town at once!

13:03.210 --> 13:06.720
{Out of obligation, we will refrain
from contacting Headquarters.}To show our gratitude, we will not 
report you to headquarters.

13:06.720 --> 13:09.760
Hey, Navy guy!
{How can you talk like that?!}What the hell are you saying?!

13:09.760 --> 13:13.560
{Even you guys were subdued
and terrified of Morgan!}Even <i>you all</i> were terrified 
of Morgan's iron rule!

13:13.560 --> 13:16.690
We owe these people our lives!

13:16.690 --> 13:18.270
Yeah! Yeah!

13:21.810 --> 13:23.970
{Well, guess we should go!}Well then, gotta go!

13:23.970 --> 13:25.280
Thanks for the food, lady!

13:25.280 --> 13:28.200
You guys are leaving already?

13:28.200 --> 13:29.490
Yeah.

13:36.930 --> 13:38.850
Aren't you part of their crew?

13:38.850 --> 13:40.840
Huh? I...

13:40.840 --> 13:42.800
I'm...

13:46.480 --> 13:47.340
Hold it!

13:47.340 --> 13:50.100
Well? Is he?!

13:50.100 --> 13:53.350
{I know what he's done until now.}I know all about his past.

13:54.350 --> 13:56.100
Luffy-<i>san </i>! You wouldn't!

13:56.820 --> 13:59.680
There was this {reaaally}really, 
<i>really</i> fat pirate lady,

13:59.680 --> 14:01.270
I think her name was {Ahiruda}Ahilda.

14:01.270 --> 14:03.500
Luffy-<i>san </i>!

14:03.500 --> 14:05.950
If they find out I was
on a pirate ship,

14:05.950 --> 14:08.570
I'll never get to join the Navy!

14:08.570 --> 14:13.240
And she had this iron club.
Man, she was an ugly hag!

14:14.290 --> 14:17.580
And for two whole years,
this guy was her–

14:17.580 --> 14:22.090
Please don't!
Please don't, Luffy-<i>san </i>!

14:22.980 --> 14:24.050
Shut up!

14:31.340 --> 14:32.970
Now you've done it, you bastard!

14:32.970 --> 14:36.270
Damn {you}bastard!
{Damn you}Take that! {Damn you}And that!

14:38.440 --> 14:40.560
Stop that!

14:40.560 --> 14:43.650
{We won't allow you to cause
any more trouble in this town!}There's already been enough trouble 
in this town as it is!

14:44.610 --> 14:47.900
Hey! You've gone too far.
That's enough.

14:54.220 --> 14:56.880
It's {very }clear that you
guys aren't {crewmates}crewmates!

14:56.880 --> 14:59.330
Now, leave this town {at once}immediately!

15:05.420 --> 15:07.880
On purpose...

15:09.020 --> 15:11.140
He did that on purpose...

15:15.010 --> 15:17.060
For me...

15:17.060 --> 15:20.870
He purposely got me riled up
to make me hit him...

15:22.510 --> 15:27.480
Even in the very end,
I wound up relying on him!

15:30.740 --> 15:33.700
Nothing's changed at all!

15:35.700 --> 15:38.160
{Am I an idiot?!}Am I that dense?!

15:38.750 --> 15:40.120
Please!

15:40.980 --> 15:43.980
Please...
let me join the Navy!

15:43.980 --> 15:46.920
I'll gladly {do chores}be a cabin boy
or anything else!

15:46.920 --> 15:49.340
If it means I can be marine!

15:52.340 --> 15:55.300
Commander!
I'm against the idea!{DemonRin, VIZ identifies this rank as "lieutenant", but it could be a mistranslation.}

15:56.220 --> 15:58.800
I still {don't}can't fully trust this kid!

15:58.800 --> 16:01.940
{There have been cases of marines
being pirate spies!}There are reports of pirates 
planting spies among marines.

16:01.940 --> 16:05.600
We'll first need to conduct
a background check–

16:05.600 --> 16:08.940
{I'm a man who will become
a Navy officer!}The man you see before you <i>will</i> 
become a Navy officer!

16:16.010 --> 16:19.010
{Countless comrades of ours
have been killed by pirates.}We cannot number how many
of us have fallen to pirates.

16:19.010 --> 16:20.790
{Don't take the Navy lightly.}Do not take the Navy lightly.

16:22.260 --> 16:24.880
– Then...
 – Permission to join: granted!

16:27.030 --> 16:28.800
Yes, sir!

16:29.730 --> 16:31.940
{That was a pretty lame act.}Your acting was horrible.

16:31.940 --> 16:34.330
Wouldn't be shocked
if they saw through it.

16:34.330 --> 16:37.760
{Koby'll handle the rest on
his own now. I just know it.}It's all up to Koby now. 
I'm sure he's got this.

16:37.760 --> 16:39.520
{It's a nice way to leave, though.}It seems right to leave this way.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.730
{Being unable to turn back
'cause everyone hates you–}No turning back 
'cause we're hated...

16:41.730 --> 16:43.480
{it's pirate-like!}How pirate-esque!

16:45.020 --> 16:45.960
{That's true!}Good point!

16:45.960 --> 16:47.400
Luffy-<i>san </i>!

16:49.230 --> 16:53.780
Thank you! I'll never forget
all you've done for me!

16:53.780 --> 16:58.260
{I've never heard of a pirate
being thanked by a marine...}First I've heard of 
a marine thanking a pirate.

17:01.250 --> 17:03.710
{Let's meet again sometime, Koby!}We'll meet again, Koby!

17:03.710 --> 17:07.210
– Luffy-<i>san</i>...
– Bye!

17:07.210 --> 17:09.880
{All hands, salute!}'Ten-<i>shun </i>!

17:12.840 --> 17:15.800
See ya!

17:16.640 --> 17:18.760
That's a great friend
you have there.

17:24.320 --> 17:25.390
Yes, sir!

17:26.630 --> 17:31.230
{Our salute just now is
in violation of naval law!}It's against Navy regulations 
to salute pirates the way we just did!

17:31.230 --> 17:35.110
{Therefore, we will all go without
food for three days! Understood?!}As punishment, no rations 
for three days! Understood?!

17:35.110 --> 17:36.000
Yes, sir!

17:39.240 --> 17:41.740
All right! Let's go!

17:41.740 --> 17:47.380
Set sail for the Grand Line!
